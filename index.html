			Visualizing the 2017-18 WA State Legislature</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In his <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/news-media/speeches/2018-state-state">2018 State of the State
speech</a>,
Washington State Governor Jay Inslee
made a passioned appeal for a carbon tax and proposed one in Washington
State Senate bill
<a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6203&amp;Year=2017">6203</a>.
Because of this, I paid more attention to the
activities of the Washington State Legislature than I ever had before
and I found it fascinating.</p>

<p>First off, lets start with the website for the state Legislature. Here
is a screenshot of the
Washington State Legislature page for SB 6203 which is the bill I was
most interested in:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_6203.png"></p>

<p>The website is very resource dense and well worth time exploring when
the Legislature is in session. Every piece of proposed legislation
shows the same amount of information and allows you to easily find and
contact your legislators about a particular bill if interested. The site
also has livestreams of <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6203&amp;Year=2017#videoSection">committee
hearings</a>
and displays <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/far/Senate/Calendar">vote
counts</a> on bills in almost
real time as the votes are tallied on both the
Senate and the House floor.</p>

<p>Is Washington state unique in this regard? Of course not, here is a
screen shot for an interesting bill in Legislature for the State of
California.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/CA_827.png"></p>

<p>Finally here is a screenshot of a House bill on the United States
Congress website</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/HR_5031.png"></p>

<p>Does ease of use of the website increase participation in the civic
process at the state level? That is a difficult question to answer but
personally I am glad I get to use the Washington State one instead of
the California state Legislature webpage.</p>

<p>The 2017-18 Washington State Legislative Session ended on <a href="http://leg.wa.gov/legislature/Documents/2018CutoffCalendar.pdf">March 8,
2018</a>
and
Governor Inslee then had 21 days to sign bills into law or veto them.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the 2017-18 Session made me wonder what happened to
those bills that were introduced and how many of them actually became
law.
In addition to a great website, the Washington State
Legislature also has an excellent set of <a href="http://wslwebservices.leg.wa.gov/">Web
Services</a> that allow for
programmatically
capturing metrics and data about activities in the state
legislation. One way to easily visualize this is with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">Sankey
Diagram</a> (no relation to
this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iec080MWCs">Sankey</a> though).</p>

<p>Here is a smaller image of the diagram with a larger version [here]</p>

			Has the Pac-12 Network Decreased UW Home Football Game Attendance UPDATED</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Following up on my earlier
<a href="http://zachstednick.name/blog/2016/09/02/has-the-pac-12-network-decreased-uw-home-football-game-attendance/">post</a>,
how much has the Pac-12 Network affected game attendance? I updated my previous data set to include the past two seasons so as to include 2008-2017 data. I relied on home game
attendance as reported by Wikipedia and also used Wikipedia to determine what TV network broadcast each home game. In an ideal world I would be able to make better comparisons using the <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/solutions/measurement/television.html">Nielsen rating</a>
for each game however my guess is that data does not come as cheap or as
easily as data from Wikipedia. For the purposes of this analysis I am
neglecting various other factors in this anaysis
such as time at kickoff, game day temperature, opponent, ranking of UW,
ranking of opponent, etc&hellip; the list goes on and on. My main intention
was
to simply show home game attendance versus TV network for all games:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/UW_football_attendance_by_TV_2008-17.png"></p>

<p>And attendance for Pac-12 only opponents versus TV network:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/UW_football_attendance_by_TV_2008-17_Pac12_only.png"></p>

<p>Based on the available data it appears that attendance during home games
has
been influenced and possibly decreased by the Pac-12 Network but it is
difficult to say for sure while ignoring so many external factors. With
a significant budget deficit still a major
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/uw-regents-assail-ex-athletic-director-over-growing-deficit/">issue</a>,
one can only hope that losses from game day ticket sales are made up for
with Pac-12 Network advertising revenue.</p>

			States With Multiple Football Teams in the AP Top 25</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>With <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400935292">WSU beating
Oregon</a> and
<a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400935293">UW beating UC
Berkeley</a>,
the State of Washington is poised to have two football teams in the top
ten of NCAA Division I football rankings. Naturally this got me
thinking, how often does this happen and how many states have had this
same achievement?</p>

<p>To answer this I used the weekly results of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Poll">Associated Press
poll</a> which started in 1936 and
thanks to our good friends at <a href="https://donate.wikimedia.org">Wikipedia</a>,
I was able to get AP Poll results for every week.</p>

<p>I found that 25 states had at least one week where two teams from that
state were in the AP Poll. However, the more I thought about it the more
I realized this was slightly biased because some states might only have
one team (i.e. Wyoming) while other states might have two Division I
teams that are never both great at the same time (i.e. Montana). I
tightened down my restrictions a bit and only looked at the top 10 teams
from each AP Poll.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, of the 25 states with at least two teams in the AP top 25
Poll,
21 of those states had a week with at least two teams from that state in the AP top 10.
I made a summary table with the most recent year each state achieved
this distinction listed:</p>

<p>Then, I thought what if there were ever a week when a state had 3 teams
in the AP top 10. Sure enough, four states have achieved this:</p>

		<p>I wanted to revist my previous
<a href="http://zachstednick.name/blog/2017/08/09/smarter-binge-watching-with-linear-regression/">post</a>
continuing to look at using linear
regression for determining the best
episodes of a TV show to watch. I started to think about how to look at
this data for multiple TV shows. Performing a linear regression on show
rating by episode number within a season quickly allows us to determine
the maximum and minimum residual for all the show episodes. I took this
a step further and
calculated which episode of the show it was. For example, here are all
the episodes with residual value for that particular show <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4635276/">Master of
None</a>:</p>

<p>We can see that the episode with the highest residual is S2E1 &ldquo;The
Thief&rdquo; and the episode with the lowest residual is S2E7 &ldquo;Door #3&rdquo;. For
every TV show I took all the episodes and calculated their order as a percent of
the total number of episodes - for example the pilot episode would be 0.0 and the
series
finale would be 1.0 to generate an index. I then took the
maximum and minimum residual values for each show and plotted them
against that episode. For example here is a plot of just Master of None:</p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/mon_min_max.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="height:500px; width:800px;" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>To obtain data on as many shows as I could I used this <a href="http://www.imdb.com/search/title?at=0&amp;num_votes=5000,&amp;sort=user_rating,de">IMDb
list</a>
of shows with over 5000 votes and selected the first 1200 shows as a
dataset. I then reused the <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb API</a> as I did before. I then calculated the same values as I did for Master of None
above and plotted them in a similar manner (use the mouseover for more
information on each point):</p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/imdb_min_max.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="height:500px; width:800px;" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>Two things immediately jump out at me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The density of points right around the zero line shows that linear
regression is a pretty good metric to use for this type of analysis and
that most people rate the show generally in line with the overall trend
for that particular season.</p></li>
<li><p>There seems to be a tendancy for people to really love or really hate
the series finale of TV shows and this shows up by the sheer number of
points at 1. Possibly this is people expressing their overall view of
the show as a whole or maybe people really were really happy or unhappy
with the series finale.</p></li>

<p>I put some of the main code I used in a <a href="https://github.com/stedy/blog-supplemental">GitHub

			Smarter Binge Watching With Linear Regression</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I am not much of a binge watcher but I do enjoy quality TV shows which
is why I think <a href="http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/">GraphTV</a> is so
great. GraphTV plots the IMDb user ratings for every episode
and then performs a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">linear regression</a> of
the episode rating by the episode number to create a trend line which
helps you see if the show gets better or worse over the course of the
season.</p>

<p>This is nice but it can get difficult to use GraphTV for shows like
<a href="http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/tt0088526">Golden Girls</a> and
downright impossible for shows like <a href="http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/tt0096697">The
Simpsons</a>.</p>

<p>To solve this I created a GitHub repo
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/binge-trendy">binge-trendy</a>. Because the trend
line is fit to the IMDb user rating data, we are
interested in which episodes do IMDb users think are better than the
regression model predicts which translates to any deviation from the
trend line. Since I am only interested in episodes that are
rated higher than the regression model would have predicted,
I only look at episodes with a positive residual.</p>

<p>For example, Golden Girls season 4</p>

			Standing Up for Net Neutrality</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Currently there are many political issues that demand
attention however in my opinion there are none that would affect more
people than the possible destruction of net neutrality.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">Net neutrality</a> is simply the principle that all data on the internet
should be treated the same. It does not matter if you are visiting Fox
News or Mother Jones - the data and content from both of these
websites (as well as from every other website) should be treated as
equal and that data should be served equally by all Internet Service Providers. Losing net neutrality could
lead to an internet that favors
one of these two sites based on which site is willing to pay more. I
chose these sites because they are such polar opposites but at the same
time we live in a country that allows for such opposites to
have equal protection of freedom of speech. I may disagree with the content of a particular
website but
I do not think it should be served any differently than the website of a
site I do agree with. Destruction of net neutrality will lead to greater
influence wielded by larger corporations and could
stifle smaller websites and startups.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is still time to act. On July 12, various online
communities and users will come together to stand tall and sound the
alarm about the FCC&rsquo;s attack on net neutrality. Join us
<a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12">here</a>!</p>

			Pronto Post-mortem</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Pronto bike share ends this Friday March 31st and I will miss it for
sure. I <a href="http://zachstednick.name/blog/2016/02/09/thoughts-on-pronto/">wrote about why Pronto mattered to me</a> and I
even rode a Pronto bike in the 25
mile <a href="http://www.obliteride.org/">Obliteride</a> last year:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/IMG_2260.JPG"></p>

<p>In October 2015, there was a Pronto sponsored
<a href="https://www.prontocycleshare.com/datachallenge">contest</a> to visualize
bikeshare ride data. I created an
<a href="http://prontostories.com/">entry</a> which although did not win, was a
nice introduction for me to learn mapping with
<a href="d3js.org">D3</a>. As I was
checking out the Pronto site one last time today I noticed that they had
updated their publically available dataset to include 2016
ride data as well as the 2015 ride data.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/pronto_historical_ridership.png"></p>

<p>To me it seems that Pronto had a hard time expanding and encouraging
repeat riders. Unfortunately we do not have the membership data but if
we can assume that people who did not ride much in 2015 did not renew
their membership in 2016 then it looks pretty clear that Pronto was hurting
more than people thought. Also, it looked like they had good success in
2015 with getting people to buy day passes especially during peak tourist
season in the summer and were able to replicate that success in 2016. I
feel there is a need for a dedicated
bike share in Seattle however this iteration of bike share does not
appear to be the solution we need.</p>

<p>I went back to the Pronto site to fetch all my data because of an idea I
worked on then abandoned last summer. The idea was for a website that
was basically <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> for Pronto
whereby you compared your ride time data to everyone else&rsquo;s and mapped out how
fast you were compared to them. Pronto did not make it easy to download
all your trip data so I ended up having to write a webscraper to get out
my own data (Hint, hint Pronto 2.0!) which I put at this <a href="https://github.com/stedy/pronto-scraper">GitHub
repository</a>. I never was able
to get my project past the personal level and my ultimate goal was to
simply make a map of the route and add
in plots. Here is an example of all trips from Fairview Ave N &amp; Ward St
to Westlake Ave &amp; 6th Ave:</p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/strava_for_pronto_demo.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="height:700px; width:1260px;" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>I&rsquo;m sad that I can&rsquo;t work on this project anymore but maybe with Pronto
2.0 I will be able to revist this idea.</p>

			Have There Been More Upsets in the NCAA Tournament Recently?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have been following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament">NCAA Men&rsquo;s Basketball
Tournament</a>
for as long
as I can remember and with Selection Sunday coming up, I wondered if
there
have been more or less upsets in recent tournaments. To look at this
visually I used a hypothetical perfect bracket as a reference (i.e. #1
seed beats #16 seed, #2 seed beats #15 seed all the way to #1 seed beating a #2 seed). I
took the sum of all the winning seed numbers at each round in the
Regional Tournament and used that as the denominator
for comparison with the other Regional Tournaments for that particular
year.</p>

<p>I went back in time as far as I could but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NCAA_Division_I_Men's_Basketball_Tournament">2007
Tournament</a>
finally harmonized the names of the Regional tournaments with the names
East, West, South, and
Midwest which made for easier comparison across years.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/NCAA_by_region.png"></p>

<p>Clearly there have been quite a lot of upsets in the past ten years
especially within the Midwest Region.</p>

<p>I then went back and looked at all games back to 1985 when
the Tournament first expanded to 64 teams. For this I did not have all
the Regional Tournament information so I just looked at all the games
(except the Final Four).</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/NCAA_all_by_year.png"></p>

<p>The aggregate data is pretty volatile year over year as well with a low
in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NCAA_Division_I_Men's_Basketball_Tournament">2007</a>. If anything, this shows we should be in for another great year of NCAA tournament basketball complete with some (hopefully many) exciting upsets.</p>

			A Forgotten Cron Job Leads to Interesting Results</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On January 1, 2016 I set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> job to perform a daily count of the number of Twitter followers of the two main Gubernatorial candidates in Washington State: <a href="https://twitter.com/GovInslee">Jay Inslee</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BillBryantWA">Bill Bryant</a>. I was not attempting to predict the election or do anything with the data, I just wanted to count followers until Election Day 2016 and hopefully plot some interesting results. I checked on Election Day and the trend lines remained pretty much the same as they did at the start of the year so I abandonded my idea. Today I was cleaning out my crontab file and I found that the cron job was still running. I added a solid line for the 2016 Election Day and dashed line for the 2017 Presidential Inauguration.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Inslee_vs_Bryant.png"></p>

<p>To me, the follower count data after the inauguration is the most interesting but it is just count data and I am not sure how much you can really read into it. If anything, forgetting the cron job was a pleasant surprise that reminded me of this guy who took a screenshot of the New York Times frontpage everyday for 5 years <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCKGOiauJCE">YouTube</a>.</p>

			First Book of the Year</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last year I started off the year by making Ashlee Vance&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/15743242/book/124695914">biography</a>
of Elon Musk the first book I read all year.
I wanted to start 2016 off better than 2015 and thought this book might
help my thinking. The story is on Musk is quite interesting if anything
to simply show how much he believes in himself even when the odds seem
stacked against him and the money in the bank grows lower. I tried to
use Musk&rsquo;s story to improve my own self-confidence and I felt like the most concrete way I
was able to do so was to reduce the amount I took on and instead focus
on doing a better job of what I had in front of me.</p>

<p>I will be repeating this little project in 2017 by starting the year off
by reading <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/8586497">Spread Spectrum:Hedy Lamarr and
the mobile phone</a> by Rob
Walters. I know very little about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum">spread spectrum
technology</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr">Hedy
Lamarr</a> had a very
interesting life and is greatly underappreciated in
modern society. Hopefully this book will prove to be as motivational
over the course of the year in a similar manner as Musk&rsquo;s biography was.</p>
