			Have Any Cities Had a Team in the Championship Game for the Four Major Professional Sports?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season">Tampa Bay
Buccaneers</a>
are set to play in (and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LV">host</a>!) the Super Bowl
becoming the third professional sports team from the City of Tampa to go to a championship
game within a year. Tampa does not currently have an NBA team so they
cannot be represented in all four championship games of the major
professional sports leagues. However, Miami does have an NBA team and
also played in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Miami_Heat_season">2020 NBA
finals</a>
so a pretty good year for professional sports in the State of Florida. Naturally,
this made me wonder if any state has ever had a team in all four
championship games in a calendar year. In 1980 Pennysylvania
accomplished exactly this:</p>

<table>

</tbody>
</table>


<p>1980 must have been a great year to live in the Keystone State!</p>

<p>Obviously not every state has a team in all four of the major sports
leagues but when did each state last have a team play in a championship game?
Here are all states with a championship game drought lasting longer than
ten years:</p>

<p>I wrote all my analysis code and put it in a repo
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/blog-supplemental">here</a>. Finally all of this
talk of 1980s sports made me think of one of the greatest music videos
ever:</p>

			The Great Influenza Review</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>NB:</em> I initally wrote this with the goal of submitting to
<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">SlateStarCodex</a> however things are on hold
with that site so I thought I would just post here instead.</p>

<p>As I get older, I find that I am less willing to tolerate bad books. In
the past, out of a strange sense of guilt, I would force myself to keep
reading books even though I did not enjoy them. Nowadays, if I am
starting to get bored with a book I will stop reading as early as
possible and move on to other books. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Influenza">The Great
Influenza</a> by John M.
Berry challenged this mantra immensely.</p>

<p>This was a book I had heard quite a bit about over the past few years
and had long been interested in reading it. I have a background in
public health, attended Johns Hopkins University and I wanted to learn
more about influenza outbreaks - all of which made me excited to finally
sit down and read this book.</p>

<p>This book starts off by making two compelling arguments - the first is
that the US medical education system was incredibly weak in 1918 and
most medical doctors had no real expertise or training upon graduation
and the second argument is that the outbreak began at an army camp in Kansas.
Both of these arguments are methodically presented with extensive
background by the author. About halfway through the book, as the
influenza epidemic continues to grow larger, the author abandons both of
these arguments and shifts to more of a focus on how different
communities and the US Government responded to the outbreak. The author
argues that the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine was intented to improve
medical education in the US and was based on the medical education system in German Universities. Many of the
early founders of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine are extensively
profiled, only to completely disappear from the book entirely over the
course of the book. This is not uncommon, many
individuals are introduced, given a thorough background and then never
mentioned again.</p>

<p>In the Afterword, the author says he had hoped this book would take only
1-2 years to complete and it ended up taking him seven years to
complete. This is evident as there are many examples of the author
describing events and people in excessive detail only for the event or
person never to never be mentioned again. For example &ldquo;Cincinnati&rsquo;s public health agencies had examined 7,058
influenza victims since the epidemic had ended and found that 5,264
needed some medical assistance; 643 of them had heart problems, and an
extraordinary number of prominent citizens who had influenza had died
suddenly early in 1919.&rdquo; (p. 392) This is the first time in the book
that Cincinnati is mentioned in the book and it is unclear what exactly
these statistical counts add to the narrative as Cincinnati is never
mentioned again.</p>

<p>This book is sorely in need of an editor to prune some of the
superfluous text. For example:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It also seemed - although this was not scientifically established -
that those who went to bed the earliest, stayed there the longest, and
had the best care survived at the highest rates. Those findings meant of
course that the poor died in larger numbers than the rich.&rdquo; (p. 408)</p>

<p>Some basic run on sentences:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten days, two weeks, sometimes even longer than two weeks after the
initial attack by the virus, after victims had felt better, after
recovery had seemed to begin, victims were suddenly getting seriously
ill again. And they were dying.&rdquo; (p. 317)</p>

<p>Reading page after page of this is exhausting.</p>

<p>This is not to say the book is all bad. There are some interesting
parallels between today and the 1918 outbreak that are worth exploring.
For example in 1918, President Wilson did not mention the
outbreak at all in public and very rarely if at all in private with his
staff. The US Surgeon General at the time, Rupert Blue, was extremely slow
to even ask for influenza infection counts and instead focused on
extolling patriotism by the virtues of Liberty Loans. In Phoenix and
Philadelphia, &ldquo;Citizens Committees&rdquo; were created by private citizen
groups who took it upon themselves to act to enforce quarantine and sanitation ordinances.</p>

<p>Finally, I was cautiously optimistic about the Afterword,
written ten years after publication in 2018, and I hoped it would be a
breath of fresh air. Sadly it is not. The author rants in the Afterword by claiming that wearing face masks is useless and that the only thing
that might get society through a similar epidemic is belief in our
elected leaders.</p>

<p>In many ways, reading this book is like performing a science experiment
in the sense that there is an interesting story present but to get to it one must sift through a great deal of noise. The book as a whole was moderately
interesting but far, far too long. For additional background I would
also suggest reading the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">Wikipedia page about the 1918
Flu</a> instead.</p>

			The First Book of the Year Is Always a Biography</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For the past few years I have tried to start each New Year off by
selecting a biography as the first book I read that particular year.
I have no specific methodology as to why I choose the biographies I do,
often
it is from something tangential to the topic of the biography or just
because I am interested in the topic in general. Here are some of my
recent picks
as well as my pick for 2020:</p>

<p><strong>2016 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/15743242">Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic
Future</a></strong></p>

<p>I picked up this one largely because I was interested in Elon Musk and
curious to learn more about him. This book was illuminating in regards
to how much self-confidence Musk has in himself and how much he was
willing to double down on himself and how frequently that was
all he needed to move on to more stable ground.</p>

<p><strong>2017 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/8586497">Spread Spectrum</a></strong></p>

<p>I was interested in reading more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr">Hedy
Lamarr</a> and this book seemed
like a great place to start. It was self-published and quite bizarre at
times but it did explain technical details quite well and was well-paced
which more than made up for the author&rsquo;s unconventional asides.</p>

<p><strong>2018 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/1653761">The Man Who Fed the World: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Norman
Borlaug and His Battle to End World
Hunger</a></strong></p>

<p>I was
really interested in learning more about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug">Borlaug</a> and his
contributions to agronomy but this particular biography was sloppy and
rife with colloquialisms. Borlaug was a fascinating character who likely
saved billions of people from starvation and demands a better biography
than this one.</p>

<p><strong>2019 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/22229559">I Am Dynamite!: A Life of
Nietzsche</a></strong></p>

<p>I did not initially set out to read this book as my first book of the
year. Unfortunately, the book I had
planned on reading, <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/18814688">In the Great Green Room: The Brilliant and Bold Life
of Margaret Wise</a>, was so
bad
that I bailed on it and read the Nietzsche biography instead. Prior to
reading, I was aware of
Nietzsche if only because of the famous &ldquo;God is dead&rdquo; quote and
something
vaguely related to Nazism. I was fascinated to learn more about him and
how
his writings were completely reappropriated after his death. This was
one of the better books I read all year.</p>

<p>Finally, in 2020 the first book I am reading is <strong><a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/14139984">Empress Dowager Cixi:
The Concubine Who Launched Modern
China</a></strong>. Each year I try
to alternate between male and female biographies and after bailing on
the biography of Margaret Wise last year, I felt it was time to read a
female biography to start 2020. I am also quite interested in China and while
I realize this book might be quite revisionist am curious to learn more
about Cixi and her role in developing modern day China.</p>

			Impact of Amazon Echo on Babies Named Alexa</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few years ago, there was an article in the Seattle Times about <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/for-4-seattle-women-called-alexa-its-fun-frustrating-to-share-name-with-amazon-device/">girls
named Alexa post-introduction of the Amazon
Echo</a>.
I was chatting with a friend of mine about this and we wondered if the
introduction of the Amazon Echo has lead to a reduction in girls named
Alexa. According to Wikipedia, the Amazon Echo was first introduced on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo">November 6, 2014</a> and Hadley
Wickham was kind enough to organize an R package of baby names as
recorded by the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/babynames">United States
SSA</a>. Using this data shows a
steep decline in the number of female babies named Alexa which may be
due to a variety of factors:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/alexa_females.png"></p>

<p>In the process of making this first plot I realized that there are boys
in the SSA data named Alexa as well, lets see what the data for boys looks like:</p>

			What Is the Most Remote Airport From the City It Serves in the United States?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Recently, there was a question on
<a href="https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/137558/what-is-the-most-remote-airport-from-the-center-of-the-city-it-supposedly-serves">travel.SE</a> about locating the airport furthest
from the city it is supposed to serve. There are some interesing answers
including the winner from Paris where the airport is approximately 147
km away from the Paris metro area. I started to wonder about this
question for different airports
within the US and I stumbled onto this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia page</a>
which served as a good baseline for a quick analysis.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/places/">Google Maps location
API</a> to calculate
latitude and longitude
for the center
of the town or city and location of the airport. I then used the Google
Maps directions API to calculate the driving distance between the
airport and the center of the town it serves. This lead to some
interesting edge cases. For example, Peach Springs, Arizona is on this
list and the airport is about 113 miles away:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/peach_springs_drive.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach_Springs,_Arizona">Peach Springs</a> is a Census Designated Place and largely serves the
Hualapai tribe. Should it have been included on this list?</p>

<p>I also noticed on this Wikipedia page that there are many airports with
split locations (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma_International_Airport">Sea/Tac
Airport</a>
for example)
or a single airport serving multiple locations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg_International_Airport">Harrisburg
International
Airport</a>
serving
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middletown,_Dauphin_County,_Pennsylvania">Middletown,
PA</a>).
For these cases I just used
the first city mentioned for this analysis. The Wikipedia article also
lists
enplanements as recorded by the FAA in 2015 which provides a useful
metric for comparison. First I looked
at distance to airport versus number of passengers:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/airport_all.png"></p>

<p>Not too surprising to observe that many of the airports have very few
emboardings each year and are reasonably close to the center of town.</p>

<p>Then I looked at only airports that had over one million enplanements
which narrowed my list of airports down to 27:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/airport_1mil.png"></p>

<p>To me it is interesting to note that San Diego, Boston and to some
extent Dulles are all close to the city center with relatively few
emboardings as compared to this subset. Also, I grew up in Fort Collins,
CO and have many fond memories as a child of driving across the plains
with Denver International Airport seeming so, so far away.</p>

			Changes in Voter Turnout Between the 2014 and 2018 US Elections</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I watched the livestream of the 2018 US midterm election results, I
was absolutely stunned at the significant increase in voter turnout over
the 2014 US midterm election. Now that almost all of the 2018 election
results have been certified by their repective Secretaries of State, I
wanted to take a look at how this increase in voter turnout manifested
on a state by state basis.</p>

<p>To make things as simple as I could, I primarily used the data from two
New York Times elections pages: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2014/results/house">2014 results
page</a> and the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-house-elections.html">2018 results
page</a>.</p>

<p>I realize this data may not be complete as some of the voter counts are
not fully reported for all precincts on these pages. However, the total
vote count from the 2014 data is 72,031,124 while the total vote count
from 2018 is 106,385,810 which I felt was accurate enough for the
purposes of this analysis.</p>

<p>In both elections, I primarily focused on the House of Representatives
because that was the only office for universally up for election. As I
embarked on this project I soon realized that a direct comparison would
not be possible after Pennslyvania <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania's_congressional_districts">re-drew its congressional maps in
early
2018</a>
and Florida did so as well in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida%27s_congressional_districts">2016
redistricting</a>.</p>

<p>This first map simply shows congressional districts where the voter
turnout increased. The congressional districts colored grey have either
a decline in voter turnout, or where the candidate ran uncontested in
either 2014 or 2018 (or both) and therefore do not have a difference in
percentage to measure.</p>

<p>Explorable version
<a href="http://zachstednick.com/US_house_diff_map_pos_only.html">here</a></p>

<p>The second choropleth map shows states that increased in voter turnout
as blue, states that decreased in voter turnout as red while those
colored grey had at least one uncontested election.</p>

<a href="http://zachstednick.com/house_diff_map_pos_neg.html">here</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that only seven US Congressional districts had
decreases in voter turnout from 2014 to 2018. Table of districts with
decreased voter turnout:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> District </th>
<th> 2014 votes </th>
<th> 2018 votes </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Difference</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> IL-09 </td>
<td> 203946 </td>
<td> 91476 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -55.14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> CO-01 </td>
<td> 266021 </td>
<td> 256542 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -3.56</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> PA-02 </td>
<td> 202635 </td>
<td> 197495 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -2.53</td>

<tr>
<td> AK-00 </td>
<td> 242844 </td>
<td> 238131 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -1.94</td>

<tr>

<td> 171502 </td>
<td> 170290 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -0.70</td>

<tr>
<td> KY-05 </td>
<td> 218697 </td>
<td> 218324 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -0.17</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>The district with the highest increase in turnout? That would be
<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California's_34th_Congressional_District">CA-34</a></p>

<p>Finally I grouped all the votes together by state to make the following
choropleth of US House votes on a state level:</p>

			A Visual Comparison of Votes for Two Carbon Tax Initiatives</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Washington State voters were presented two different
carbon tax initiatives in the General Elections of 2016 and 2018. A full comparison of both
proposals is
<a href="http://carbonwa.org/1631-compare-recent-carbon-pricing-proposals-washington-state/">here</a>.
While neither passed, I was curious how the Yes vote looked for both
Initiatives.</p>

<p>Overall net change in Yes votes from Initiative 732 to Initiative 1631 as a percentage of the whole by county. The more red counties are where Initiative 732 was favored more while the more blue counties are where Initiative 1631 was favored more.

			A Quick Look at the Seattle Mariners 2018 Attendance</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On September 17, 2018, the King County council <a href="https://mkcclegisearch.kingcounty.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3585391&amp;GUID=4C4DA409-D946-4189-AF23-59682F4FEF44&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search=">voted
5-4</a>
to allow for a
new funding agreement between King County and sports stadiums such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeco_Field">Safeco Field</a>. There have
already
been challenges
to the legislation and it may appear as a
<a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/residents-could-get-to-vote-whether-safeco-field-gets-its-135-million-in-county-funding">petition</a>
on the ballot soon.</p>

<p>The 2018 season was unusually successful for the Mariners, and while
they are again sitting out the Playoffs this season I did wonder what
attendance looked like this year.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Mariners_Attendance_2018.png"></p>

<p>I added two lines to this plot, one for maximum attendance (currently
47,715 according to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeco_Field#Seating_capacity">Wikipedia</a>)
and one for mean attendance which was 28,389 this year. This means that
we have a
stadium that is on average about 60% full for any game for a team that
competed for a
Playoff spot until the very end of the
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/robinson-cano-breaks-out-bat-as-mariners-score-season-high-13-runs-to-bash-rangers/">season</a>.
Is that really the best use of this money?</p>

			Sentiment Analysis of Candidate Statements by Senate Candidates</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/calendar.aspx">2018 Washington State
Primary</a> was held on
August 7, 2018. As a
registered voter in Washington State I am mailed a <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/research/2018-voters-pamphlet.aspx">Voter&rsquo;s Information
Pamphlet</a>
which lists the candidates and a Candidate
Statement (provided by the candidate) for each office. The Candidate
Statement is where the candidate is allowed to write anything they want
as long as its under 300 words. I was curious if there was any
relationship between the sentiment of a candidate&rsquo;s Statement and the
number of votes
that candidate received.</p>

<p>I conducted my analysis using sentiment analysis which groups words
together based on
pre-defined lists of words that are members of that group. There are
many word groups to choose from such as &ldquo;joy&rdquo; and &ldquo;trust&rdquo; but for this
analysis I just looked at &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;negative&rdquo; words (as classified
by <a href="http://www.saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">NRC</a>).</p>

<p>Although there were many different offices up for election in this Primary,
the U.S. Senate race had 29 candidates which made for a very rich
dataset. Washington State uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary">Top-Two
Primary</a>
which allows for easy comparison across political parties.</p>

<p>There are many factors deliberately ignored by this analysis such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index">PVI</a>,
incumbency, fundraising, political party and candidate issues. However I thought
text mining could
be an interesting way to analyze these candidates in a slightly
different manner.</p>

<p>First I just plotted the number of positive words in the Candidate
Statement for each candidate:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_positive.png"></p>

<p>Then I repeated with the number of negative words in the Candidate
Statement for each candidate:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_negative.png"></p>

<p>Next I looked at the number of positive words in the Candidate Statement
by candidate versus the number of votes that candidate received. Because
of the strength of the Democratic incumbent candidate <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maria_Cantwell">Maria
Cantwell</a> and the Republican
establishment candidate <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Susan_Hutchison">Susan
Hutchison</a> I had to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">log-transform</a> the vote counts because these two candidates got so much of
the total vote.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_positive_vote_count.png"></p>

<p>Then I repeated this analysis by looking at the negative word count for
each candidate versus the total log-transformed vote count:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_negative_vote_count.png"></p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t think this will lead to any novel political insights, I
do think its an interesting way to look at candidates. Full code
including individual candidate statements available

			Should Seattle Convert Public Golf Courses Into Land for Housing?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Like many other metropolitan areas, Seattle is currently dealing with a
serious housing shortage. Recently, there have been some good articles
(<a href="https://seattletransitblog.com/2018/06/11/west-seattle-can-tunnel-housing/">here</a>
and
<a href="https://fancybeans.com/2018/01/27/what-is-a-housing-emergency-really/">here</a>)
about converting public golf
courses into housing. It is an interesting concept and certainly should
be discussed, however one aspect I feel is being overlooked in this
debate
is how popular are these golf courses anyways? According to Bloomberg
News, there is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-05-25/off-for-a-round-of-golf-this-weekend-didn-t-think-so">declining interest in golf
nationwide</a>,
is this happening in
Seattle?</p>

<p>The City of Seattle is somewhat
aware of this issue and is at least discussing
<a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/ParksAndRecreation/BriefingPapers/Golf%20Park%20Board%20Briefing%20Paper%20Final%202-6-18.pdf">options</a>
for the golf courses. I filed a <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/public-records">Public Records
Request</a> act
with the City of Seattle and they sent me data on the rounds of golf
played for
the past three years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the city only provided the count data for number of
rounds of golf played per year so I cannot look at more granular trends.
However, I can plot the counts on an annual basis.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Seattle_golf_counts.png"></p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if this debate both on converting public
golf
courses to housing goes anywhere both in Seattle and other major cities.
I don&rsquo;t have a horse in this
particular race, I live near the <a href="http://premiergc.com/-jefferson-park-golf-course">Jefferson
Park course</a> and I
really appreciate the large
expanse of green it provides however I am acutely aware of the need for
more housing within Seattle city limits.</p>

<p>Interested in taking a look? I put the full data I got from the city
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/city_of_seattle_golf_counts">here</a>.</p>
