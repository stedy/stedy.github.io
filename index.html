			Cluster Analysis of World Flags</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>After spending time looking at world flags, I have started to notice similarities in flags from different countries. Sometimes the similarity may be due to historical relationships, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States of America</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia">Liberia</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a>. Other times it may be purely coincidental such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad">Chad</a>.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://zachstednick.com/romania_chad.png"> </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Flag of Romania on left, Flag of Chad on right </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p> I was interested in determining if additional relationships between flags could be discovered via mathematical analysis of the properties of each flag. To begin my analysis, I needed to find a standardized set of flag image files to make up my dataset. I started by using flags from Wikipedia but found these were too variable in size and image quality. I later ended up purchasing a set of flag image files from <a href="countryflags.com">CountryFlags</a>. I used the Python library <a href="https://github.com/obskyr/colorgram.py">colorgram</a> to scan every pixel of every flag image file and then determine each pixelâ€™s color using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB color model</a>. There are many distinct shades of every color so I grouped all shades into groups of red, yellow, blue, green, orange, white and black. For example, the blue of the Argentina flag is quite different from the blue of the Sweden flag, however for the purposes of this project I called them both blue.</p>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Flag of Argentina on left, Flag of Sweden on right </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>In addition to determining the colors of each flag I was also interested in what percentage of each flag was a specific color. By this method, the flag of France would be represented as 33% red, 33% white and 33% blue. Some country flags have smaller details with distinct colors which made classification trickier. To simplify analysis I limited my dataset to colors that appeared on at least 5% of the overall flag. For example, the flag of Belize has many small details that had to be omitted while retaining the dominant red, blue, and white color pattern.</p>

<th style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://zachstednick.com/belize_flag.png"> </th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Flag of Belize </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>After collecting the data, I implemented a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">clustering algorithm</a>, specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-means clustering</a> which is a mathematical method for grouping observations into clusters. Each cluster contains individual observations with similar values and the smaller the cluster the more similar all of the values are in that particular cluster. For an initial demonstration, I clustered the eleven country flags of South America into three clusters.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/sa_cluster.png"></p>

<p>From this figure, three clusters of interest are distinctly observed with the smallest cluster consisting of the flags of Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. We can see the other two clusters which have grouped the remaining flags of South America into two separate and larger clusters. From a historical perspective, this makes sense as most countries in South America were colonized by Spain or Brazil and became independent at approximately the same time.</p>

<p>For the analysis of all the flags of the world, I again set the number of clusters to 3 in order to simplify the visual output:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/all_flags_cluster.png"></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, there is quite a bit of overlap between the three clusters and it is difficult to ascertain how these clusters are distinct from each other. Most countries use good design patterns (For example the <a href="https://nava.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=622278&amp;module_id=475721">NAVA guide</a>), similar colors, and similar color proportions for their flags. However, there are some interesting observations and unexpected pairings that reveal themselves after studying the figure. For example, Lesotho and Uzbekistan have similar design patterns as well as similar color profiles. Another interesting pairng that does not share similar design patterns is Honduras and Greece. Also interesting to note how similar many of these flags are, with the two notable outliers being Ukraine and Niue.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;"> <img src="http://zachstednick.com/niue_flag.png"> </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;"> Flag of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niue">Niue</a> </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Cluster analysis is by no means definitive, and is more of an exploratory analysis. Regardless, I found this method a rewarding way to reconsider the design
patterns of the many flags of the world.</p>

			Pair Programming With a 13 Month Old</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">Pair Programming</a> is a
software development method that uses two programmers on one
workstation thereby writing code as a team. I did a slight variation of this on a recent
project with a thirteen month old and had pretty good success.</p>

<p>I used to really like this site <a href="http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/">GraphTV</a> and was sad when it closed. I later found <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb API</a> which I
 used to recreate GraphTV as a command line program on <a href="https://github.com/stedy/binge-trendy">GitHub</a>. But who wants to use a command line program to look
things up? I knew it could be much better hosted on its own website
which meant improving my JavaScript and a ideally use a JS charting
library (I ultimately went with <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Chart.js</a>). In a past life I wrote a lot of R code and JS often feels
incredibly foreign to me for reasons I cannot quite articulate.</p>

<p>These days I spend most of my time with a 13 month old and have pretty limited amounts of time
here and there for writing code. I do find that when working on a
programming problem that it can be incredibly easy for me
to run into a roadblock, hop on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/javascript">SO</a> and then find myself further out in the
weeds and really frustrated.</p>

<p>With this project, I took a different approach. Any time I ran into a roadblock I did a quick search on SO, read a few answers and then just closed my laptop and walked away. Granted this was not the fastest way to solve the problem but it did lead to many minor epiphanies in otherwise quotidian parenting events:</p>

<ul>
<li>Playing with some books on the floor and thinking &ldquo;The
<code>innerHTML()</code>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML">element</a> is not flushing everything out, maybe there is a
dedicated function in Chartjs&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Trying to get the 13 month old to eat more and thinking &ldquo;Why am I using this unwieldy CSV file when I could simplify my code so much
with a JSON object&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Changing a diaper and thinking &ldquo;Well, I have tried everything else, did Bootstrap change something between v4.5 and <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/">5.0</a>?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>I finally finished my project and launched
<a href="http://bingetrendy.com/">bingetrendy</a>!
I am not nor will ever be a shredding programmer and I am okay with
that. I also realize that not everyone might have their own 13 month old to help distract them.
However, I strongly feel that walking away from my code for extended periods of time
was beneficial for me and may be beneficial for you as well. Now if you
will excuse me, the 13 month old is asleep and I want to figure out what
episodes of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472954/episodes?season=6">It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia Season
6</a> I should
watch.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season">Tampa Bay

are set to play in (and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LV">host</a>!) the Super Bowl
becoming the third professional sports team from the City of Tampa to go to a championship
game within a year. Tampa does not currently have an NBA team so they
cannot be represented in all four championship games of the major
professional sports leagues. However, Miami does have an NBA team and
also played in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Miami_Heat_season">2020 NBA
finals</a>
so a pretty good year for professional sports in the State of Florida. Naturally,
this made me wonder if any state has ever had a team in all four
championship games in a calendar year. In 1980 Pennysylvania
accomplished exactly this:</p>

<p>1980 must have been a great year to live in the Keystone State!</p>

<p>Obviously not every state has a team in all four of the major sports
leagues but when did each state last have a team play in a championship game?
Here are all states with a championship game drought lasting longer than
ten years:</p>

<p>I wrote all my analysis code and put it in a repo
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/blog-supplemental">here</a>. Finally all of this
talk of 1980s sports made me think of one of the greatest music videos
ever:</p>

			The Great Influenza Review</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>NB:</em> I initally wrote this with the goal of submitting to
<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">SlateStarCodex</a> however things are on hold
with that site so I thought I would just post here instead.</p>

<p>As I get older, I find that I am less willing to tolerate bad books. In
the past, out of a strange sense of guilt, I would force myself to keep
reading books even though I did not enjoy them. Nowadays, if I am
starting to get bored with a book I will stop reading as early as
possible and move on to other books. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Influenza">The Great
Influenza</a> by John M.
Berry challenged this mantra immensely.</p>

<p>This was a book I had heard quite a bit about over the past few years
and had long been interested in reading it. I have a background in
public health, attended Johns Hopkins University and I wanted to learn
more about influenza outbreaks - all of which made me excited to finally
sit down and read this book.</p>

<p>This book starts off by making two compelling arguments - the first is
that the US medical education system was incredibly weak in 1918 and
most medical doctors had no real expertise or training upon graduation
and the second argument is that the outbreak began at an army camp in Kansas.
Both of these arguments are methodically presented with extensive
background by the author. About halfway through the book, as the
influenza epidemic continues to grow larger, the author abandons both of
these arguments and shifts to more of a focus on how different
communities and the US Government responded to the outbreak. The author
argues that the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine was intented to improve
medical education in the US and was based on the medical education system in German Universities. Many of the
early founders of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine are extensively
profiled, only to completely disappear from the book entirely over the
course of the book. This is not uncommon, many
individuals are introduced, given a thorough background and then never
mentioned again.</p>

<p>In the Afterword, the author says he had hoped this book would take only
1-2 years to complete and it ended up taking him seven years to
complete. This is evident as there are many examples of the author
describing events and people in excessive detail only for the event or
person never to never be mentioned again. For example &ldquo;Cincinnati&rsquo;s public health agencies had examined 7,058
influenza victims since the epidemic had ended and found that 5,264
needed some medical assistance; 643 of them had heart problems, and an
extraordinary number of prominent citizens who had influenza had died
suddenly early in 1919.&rdquo; (p. 392) This is the first time in the book
that Cincinnati is mentioned in the book and it is unclear what exactly
these statistical counts add to the narrative as Cincinnati is never
mentioned again.</p>

<p>This book is sorely in need of an editor to prune some of the
superfluous text. For example:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It also seemed - although this was not scientifically established -
that those who went to bed the earliest, stayed there the longest, and
had the best care survived at the highest rates. Those findings meant of
course that the poor died in larger numbers than the rich.&rdquo; (p. 408)</p>

<p>Some basic run on sentences:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten days, two weeks, sometimes even longer than two weeks after the
initial attack by the virus, after victims had felt better, after
recovery had seemed to begin, victims were suddenly getting seriously
ill again. And they were dying.&rdquo; (p. 317)</p>

<p>Reading page after page of this is exhausting.</p>

<p>This is not to say the book is all bad. There are some interesting
parallels between today and the 1918 outbreak that are worth exploring.
For example in 1918, President Wilson did not mention the
outbreak at all in public and very rarely if at all in private with his
staff. The US Surgeon General at the time, Rupert Blue, was extremely slow
to even ask for influenza infection counts and instead focused on
extolling patriotism by the virtues of Liberty Loans. In Phoenix and
Philadelphia, &ldquo;Citizens Committees&rdquo; were created by private citizen
groups who took it upon themselves to act to enforce quarantine and sanitation ordinances.</p>

<p>Finally, I was cautiously optimistic about the Afterword,
written ten years after publication in 2018, and I hoped it would be a
breath of fresh air. Sadly it is not. The author rants in the Afterword by claiming that wearing face masks is useless and that the only thing
that might get society through a similar epidemic is belief in our
elected leaders.</p>

<p>In many ways, reading this book is like performing a science experiment
in the sense that there is an interesting story present but to get to it one must sift through a great deal of noise. The book as a whole was moderately
interesting but far, far too long. For additional background I would
also suggest reading the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">Wikipedia page about the 1918
Flu</a> instead.</p>

			The First Book of the Year Is Always a Biography</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For the past few years I have tried to start each New Year off by
selecting a biography as the first book I read that particular year.
I have no specific methodology as to why I choose the biographies I do,
often
it is from something tangential to the topic of the biography or just
because I am interested in the topic in general. Here are some of my
recent picks
as well as my pick for 2020:</p>

<p><strong>2016 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/15743242">Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic
Future</a></strong></p>

<p>I picked up this one largely because I was interested in Elon Musk and
curious to learn more about him. This book was illuminating in regards
to how much self-confidence Musk has in himself and how much he was
willing to double down on himself and how frequently that was
all he needed to move on to more stable ground.</p>

<p><strong>2017 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/8586497">Spread Spectrum</a></strong></p>

<p>I was interested in reading more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr">Hedy
Lamarr</a> and this book seemed
like a great place to start. It was self-published and quite bizarre at
times but it did explain technical details quite well and was well-paced
which more than made up for the author&rsquo;s unconventional asides.</p>

<p><strong>2018 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/1653761">The Man Who Fed the World: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Norman
Borlaug and His Battle to End World
Hunger</a></strong></p>

<p>I was
really interested in learning more about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug">Borlaug</a> and his
contributions to agronomy but this particular biography was sloppy and
rife with colloquialisms. Borlaug was a fascinating character who likely
saved billions of people from starvation and demands a better biography
than this one.</p>

<p><strong>2019 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/22229559">I Am Dynamite!: A Life of
Nietzsche</a></strong></p>

<p>I did not initially set out to read this book as my first book of the
year. Unfortunately, the book I had
planned on reading, <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/18814688">In the Great Green Room: The Brilliant and Bold Life
of Margaret Wise</a>, was so
bad
that I bailed on it and read the Nietzsche biography instead. Prior to
reading, I was aware of
Nietzsche if only because of the famous &ldquo;God is dead&rdquo; quote and
something
vaguely related to Nazism. I was fascinated to learn more about him and
how
his writings were completely reappropriated after his death. This was
one of the better books I read all year.</p>

<p>Finally, in 2020 the first book I am reading is <strong><a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/14139984">Empress Dowager Cixi:
The Concubine Who Launched Modern
China</a></strong>. Each year I try
to alternate between male and female biographies and after bailing on
the biography of Margaret Wise last year, I felt it was time to read a
female biography to start 2020. I am also quite interested in China and while
I realize this book might be quite revisionist am curious to learn more
about Cixi and her role in developing modern day China.</p>

			Impact of Amazon Echo on Babies Named Alexa</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few years ago, there was an article in the Seattle Times about <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/for-4-seattle-women-called-alexa-its-fun-frustrating-to-share-name-with-amazon-device/">girls
named Alexa post-introduction of the Amazon
Echo</a>.
I was chatting with a friend of mine about this and we wondered if the
introduction of the Amazon Echo has lead to a reduction in girls named
Alexa. According to Wikipedia, the Amazon Echo was first introduced on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo">November 6, 2014</a> and Hadley
Wickham was kind enough to organize an R package of baby names as
recorded by the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/babynames">United States
SSA</a>. Using this data shows a
steep decline in the number of female babies named Alexa which may be
due to a variety of factors:</p>

<p>In the process of making this first plot I realized that there are boys
in the SSA data named Alexa as well, lets see what the data for boys looks like:</p>

			What Is the Most Remote Airport From the City It Serves in the United States?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Recently, there was a question on
<a href="https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/137558/what-is-the-most-remote-airport-from-the-center-of-the-city-it-supposedly-serves">travel.SE</a> about locating the airport furthest
from the city it is supposed to serve. There are some interesing answers
including the winner from Paris where the airport is approximately 147
km away from the Paris metro area. I started to wonder about this
question for different airports
within the US and I stumbled onto this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia page</a>
which served as a good baseline for a quick analysis.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/places/">Google Maps location
API</a> to calculate
latitude and longitude
for the center
of the town or city and location of the airport. I then used the Google
Maps directions API to calculate the driving distance between the
airport and the center of the town it serves. This lead to some
interesting edge cases. For example, Peach Springs, Arizona is on this
list and the airport is about 113 miles away:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/peach_springs_drive.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach_Springs,_Arizona">Peach Springs</a> is a Census Designated Place and largely serves the
Hualapai tribe. Should it have been included on this list?</p>

<p>I also noticed on this Wikipedia page that there are many airports with
split locations (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma_International_Airport">Sea/Tac
Airport</a>
for example)
or a single airport serving multiple locations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg_International_Airport">Harrisburg
International
Airport</a>
serving
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middletown,_Dauphin_County,_Pennsylvania">Middletown,
PA</a>).
For these cases I just used
the first city mentioned for this analysis. The Wikipedia article also
lists
enplanements as recorded by the FAA in 2015 which provides a useful
metric for comparison. First I looked
at distance to airport versus number of passengers:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/airport_all.png"></p>

<p>Not too surprising to observe that many of the airports have very few
emboardings each year and are reasonably close to the center of town.</p>

<p>Then I looked at only airports that had over one million enplanements
which narrowed my list of airports down to 27:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/airport_1mil.png"></p>

<p>To me it is interesting to note that San Diego, Boston and to some
extent Dulles are all close to the city center with relatively few
emboardings as compared to this subset. Also, I grew up in Fort Collins,
CO and have many fond memories as a child of driving across the plains
with Denver International Airport seeming so, so far away.</p>

			Changes in Voter Turnout Between the 2014 and 2018 US Elections</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I watched the livestream of the 2018 US midterm election results, I
was absolutely stunned at the significant increase in voter turnout over
the 2014 US midterm election. Now that almost all of the 2018 election
results have been certified by their repective Secretaries of State, I
wanted to take a look at how this increase in voter turnout manifested
on a state by state basis.</p>

<p>To make things as simple as I could, I primarily used the data from two
New York Times elections pages: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2014/results/house">2014 results
page</a> and the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-house-elections.html">2018 results
page</a>.</p>

<p>I realize this data may not be complete as some of the voter counts are
not fully reported for all precincts on these pages. However, the total
vote count from the 2014 data is 72,031,124 while the total vote count
from 2018 is 106,385,810 which I felt was accurate enough for the
purposes of this analysis.</p>

<p>In both elections, I primarily focused on the House of Representatives
because that was the only office for universally up for election. As I
embarked on this project I soon realized that a direct comparison would
not be possible after Pennslyvania <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania's_congressional_districts">re-drew its congressional maps in
early
2018</a>
and Florida did so as well in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida%27s_congressional_districts">2016
redistricting</a>.</p>

<p>This first map simply shows congressional districts where the voter
turnout increased. The congressional districts colored grey have either
a decline in voter turnout, or where the candidate ran uncontested in
either 2014 or 2018 (or both) and therefore do not have a difference in
percentage to measure.</p>

<a href="http://zachstednick.com/US_house_diff_map_pos_only.html">here</a></p>

<p>The second choropleth map shows states that increased in voter turnout
as blue, states that decreased in voter turnout as red while those
colored grey had at least one uncontested election.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that only seven US Congressional districts had
decreases in voter turnout from 2014 to 2018. Table of districts with
decreased voter turnout:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> District </th>
<th> 2014 votes </th>
<th> 2018 votes </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Difference</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> IL-09 </td>
<td> 203946 </td>
<td> 91476 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -55.14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> CO-01 </td>
<td> 266021 </td>
<td> 256542 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -3.56</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> PA-02 </td>
<td> 202635 </td>
<td> 197495 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -2.53</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> AK-00 </td>
<td> 242844 </td>
<td> 238131 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -1.94</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> IL-07 </td>
<td> 171502 </td>
<td> 170290 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -0.70</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> AR-04 </td>
<td> 205066 </td>
<td> 204113 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -0.46</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> KY-05 </td>
<td> 218697 </td>
<td> 218324 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -0.17</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>The district with the highest increase in turnout? That would be
<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California's_34th_Congressional_District">CA-34</a></p>

<p>Finally I grouped all the votes together by state to make the following
choropleth of US House votes on a state level:</p>

			A Visual Comparison of Votes for Two Carbon Tax Initiatives</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Washington State voters were presented two different
carbon tax initiatives in the General Elections of 2016 and 2018. A full comparison of both
proposals is
<a href="http://carbonwa.org/1631-compare-recent-carbon-pricing-proposals-washington-state/">here</a>.
While neither passed, I was curious how the Yes vote looked for both
Initiatives.</p>

2016), hover mouse cursor over county for exact Yes percentage.</p>

<p>Overall net change in Yes votes from Initiative 732 to Initiative 1631 as a percentage of the whole by county. The more red counties are where Initiative 732 was favored more while the more blue counties are where Initiative 1631 was favored more.

			A Quick Look at the Seattle Mariners 2018 Attendance</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On September 17, 2018, the King County council <a href="https://mkcclegisearch.kingcounty.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3585391&amp;GUID=4C4DA409-D946-4189-AF23-59682F4FEF44&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search=">voted
5-4</a>
to allow for a
new funding agreement between King County and sports stadiums such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeco_Field">Safeco Field</a>. There have
already
been challenges
to the legislation and it may appear as a
<a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/residents-could-get-to-vote-whether-safeco-field-gets-its-135-million-in-county-funding">petition</a>
on the ballot soon.</p>

<p>The 2018 season was unusually successful for the Mariners, and while
they are again sitting out the Playoffs this season I did wonder what
attendance looked like this year.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Mariners_Attendance_2018.png"></p>

<p>I added two lines to this plot, one for maximum attendance (currently
47,715 according to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeco_Field#Seating_capacity">Wikipedia</a>)
and one for mean attendance which was 28,389 this year. This means that
we have a
stadium that is on average about 60% full for any game for a team that
competed for a
Playoff spot until the very end of the
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/robinson-cano-breaks-out-bat-as-mariners-score-season-high-13-runs-to-bash-rangers/">season</a>.
Is that really the best use of this money?</p>
