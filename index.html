			What Is the Most Remote Airport From the City It Serves in the United States?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Recently, there was a question on
<a href="https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/137558/what-is-the-most-remote-airport-from-the-center-of-the-city-it-supposedly-serves">travel.SE</a> about locating the airport furthest
from the city it is supposed to serve. There are some interesing answers
including the winner from Paris where the airport is approximately 147
km away from the Paris metro area. I started to wonder about this
question for different airports
within the US and I stumbled onto this [Wikipedia
page]
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_the_United_States</a>)
which served as a good baseline for a quick analysis.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/places/">Google Maps location
API</a> to calculate
latitude and longitude
location of the center
of the town or city and location of the airport. I then used the Google
Maps directions API to calculate the driving distance between the
airport and the center of the town it serves. This lead to some
interesting edge cases. For example, Peach Springs, Arizona is on this
list and the airport is about 113 miles away:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/peach_springs_drive.png"></p>

<p>Peach Springs is a Census Designated Place and largely serves the
Hualapai tribe. Should it have been included on this list?</p>

<p>I also noticed on this Wikipedia page that there are many airports with
split locations (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma_International_Airport">Sea/Tac
Airport</a>
for example)
or a single airport serving multiple locations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg_International_Airport">Harrisburg
International
Airport</a>
serving
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middletown,_Dauphin_County,_Pennsylvania">Middletown,
PA</a>).
For these cases I just used
the first city mentioned for this analysis. The Wikipedia article also
lists
enplanements as recorded by the FAA in 2015 which provides a useful
metric for comparison. First I looked
at distance to airport versus number of passengers:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/airport_all.png"></p>

<p>Not too surprising to observe that many of the airports have very few
emboardings each year and are reasonably close to the center of town.</p>

<p>Then I looked at only airports that had over one million enplanements
which narrowed my list of airports down to 27:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/airport_1mil.png"></p>

<p>To me it is interesting to note that San Diego, Boston and to some
extent Dulles are all close to the city center with relatively few
emboardings as compared to this subset. Also I grew up in Fort Collins,
CO and have many fond memories as a child of driving across the plains
with Denver International Airport seeming so, so far away.</p>

			Changes in Voter Turnout Between the 2014 and 2018 US Elections</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I watched the livestream of the 2018 US midterm election results, I
was absolutely stunned at the significant increase in voter turnout over
the 2014 US midterm election. Now that almost all of the 2018 election
results have been certified by their repective Secretaries of State, I
wanted to take a look at how this increase in voter turnout manifested
on a state by state basis.</p>

<p>To make things as simple as I could, I primarily used the data from two
New York Times elections pages: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2014/results/house">2014 results
page</a> and the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-house-elections.html">2018 results
page</a>.</p>

<p>I realize this data may not be complete as some of the voter counts are
not fully reported for all precincts on these pages. However, the total
vote count from the 2014 data is 72,031,124 while the total vote count
from 2018 is 106,385,810 which I felt was accurate enough for the
purposes of this analysis.</p>

<p>In both elections, I primarily focused on the House of Representatives
because that was the only office for universally up for election. As I
embarked on this project I soon realized that a direct comparison would
not be possible after Pennslyvania <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania's_congressional_districts">re-drew its congressional maps in
early
2018</a>
and Florida did so as well in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida%27s_congressional_districts">2016
redistricting</a>.</p>

<p>This first map simply shows congressional districts where the voter
turnout increased. The congressional districts colored grey have either
a decline in voter turnout, or where the candidate ran uncontested in
either 2014 or 2018 (or both) and therefore do not have a difference in
percentage to measure.</p>

<p>Explorable version
<a href="http://zachstednick.com/US_house_diff_map_pos_only.html">here</a></p>

<p>The second choropleth map shows states that increased in voter turnout
as blue, states that decreased in voter turnout as red while those
colored grey had at least one uncontested election.</p>

Explorable version of this map
<a href="http://zachstednick.com/house_diff_map_pos_neg.html">here</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that only seven US Congressional districts had
decreases in voter turnout from 2014 to 2018. Table of districts with
decreased voter turnout:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> District </th>
<th> 2014 votes </th>
<th> 2018 votes </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Difference</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> IL-09 </td>
<td> 203946 </td>
<td> 91476 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -55.14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> CO-01 </td>
<td> 266021 </td>
<td> 256542 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -3.56</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> PA-02 </td>
<td> 202635 </td>
<td> 197495 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -2.53</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> AK-00 </td>
<td> 242844 </td>
<td> 238131 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -1.94</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> IL-07 </td>
<td> 171502 </td>
<td> 170290 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -0.70</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> AR-04 </td>
<td> 205066 </td>
<td> 204113 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -0.46</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> KY-05 </td>
<td> 218697 </td>
<td> 218324 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -0.17</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>The district with the highest increase in turnout? That would be
<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California's_34th_Congressional_District">CA-34</a></p>

<p>Finally I grouped all the votes together by state to make the following
choropleth of US House votes on a state level:</p>

			A Visual Comparison of Votes for Two Carbon Tax Initiatives</a>

proposals is

			A Quick Look at the Seattle Mariners 2018 Attendance</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On September 17, 2018, the King County council <a href="https://mkcclegisearch.kingcounty.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3585391&amp;GUID=4C4DA409-D946-4189-AF23-59682F4FEF44&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search=">voted
5-4</a>
to allow for a
new funding agreement between King County and sports stadiums such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeco_Field">Safeco Field</a>. There have
already
been challenges
to the legislation and it may appear as a
<a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/residents-could-get-to-vote-whether-safeco-field-gets-its-135-million-in-county-funding">petition</a>
on the ballot soon.</p>

<p>The 2018 season was unusually successful for the Mariners, and while
they are again sitting out the Playoffs this season I did wonder what
attendance looked like this year.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Mariners_Attendance_2018.png"></p>

<p>I added two lines to this plot, one for maximum attendance (currently
47,715 according to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeco_Field#Seating_capacity">Wikipedia</a>)
and one for mean attendance which was 28,389 this year. This means that
we have a
stadium that is on average about 60% full for any game for a team that
competed for a
Playoff spot until the very end of the
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/robinson-cano-breaks-out-bat-as-mariners-score-season-high-13-runs-to-bash-rangers/">season</a>.
Is that really the best use of this money?</p>

			Sentiment Analysis of Candidate Statements by Senate Candidates</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/calendar.aspx">2018 Washington State
Primary</a> was held on
August 7, 2018. As a
registered voter in Washington State I am mailed a <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/research/2018-voters-pamphlet.aspx">Voter&rsquo;s Information
Pamphlet</a>
which lists the candidates and a Candidate
Statement (provided by the candidate) for each office. The Candidate
Statement is where the candidate is allowed to write anything they want
as long as its under 300 words. I was curious if there was any
relationship between the sentiment of a candidate&rsquo;s Statement and the
number of votes
that candidate received.</p>

<p>I conducted my analysis using sentiment analysis which groups words
together based on
pre-defined lists of words that are members of that group. There are
many word groups to choose from such as &ldquo;joy&rdquo; and &ldquo;trust&rdquo; but for this
analysis I just looked at &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;negative&rdquo; words (as classified
by <a href="http://www.saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">NRC</a>).</p>

<p>Although there were many different offices up for election in this Primary,
the U.S. Senate race had 29 candidates which made for a very rich
dataset. Washington State uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary">Top-Two
Primary</a>
which allows for easy comparison across political parties.</p>

<p>There are many factors deliberately ignored by this analysis such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index">PVI</a>,
incumbency, fundraising, political party and candidate issues. However I thought
text mining could
be an interesting way to analyze these candidates in a slightly
different manner.</p>

<p>First I just plotted the number of positive words in the Candidate
Statement for each candidate:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_positive.png"></p>

<p>Then I repeated with the number of negative words in the Candidate
Statement for each candidate:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_negative.png"></p>

<p>Next I looked at the number of positive words in the Candidate Statement
by candidate versus the number of votes that candidate received. Because
of the strength of the Democratic incumbent candidate <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maria_Cantwell">Maria
Cantwell</a> and the Republican
establishment candidate <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Susan_Hutchison">Susan
Hutchison</a> I had to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">log-transform</a> the vote counts because these two candidates got so much of
the total vote.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_positive_vote_count.png"></p>

<p>Then I repeated this analysis by looking at the negative word count for
each candidate versus the total log-transformed vote count:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_negative_vote_count.png"></p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t think this will lead to any novel political insights, I
do think its an interesting way to look at candidates. Full code
including individual candidate statements available

			Should Seattle Convert Public Golf Courses Into Land for Housing?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Like many other metropolitan areas, Seattle is currently dealing with a
serious housing shortage. Recently, there have been some good articles
(<a href="https://seattletransitblog.com/2018/06/11/west-seattle-can-tunnel-housing/">here</a>
and
<a href="https://fancybeans.com/2018/01/27/what-is-a-housing-emergency-really/">here</a>)
about converting public golf
courses into housing. It is an interesting concept and certainly should
be discussed, however one aspect I feel is being overlooked in this
debate
is how popular are these golf courses anyways? According to Bloomberg
News, there is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-05-25/off-for-a-round-of-golf-this-weekend-didn-t-think-so">declining interest in golf
nationwide</a>,
is this happening in
Seattle?</p>

<p>The City of Seattle is somewhat
aware of this issue and is at least discussing
<a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/ParksAndRecreation/BriefingPapers/Golf%20Park%20Board%20Briefing%20Paper%20Final%202-6-18.pdf">options</a>
for the golf courses. I filed a <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/public-records">Public Records
Request</a> act
with the City of Seattle and they sent me data on the rounds of golf
played for
the past three years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the city only provided the count data for number of
rounds of golf played per year so I cannot look at more granular trends.
However, I can plot the counts on an annual basis.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Seattle_golf_counts.png"></p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if this debate both on converting public
golf
courses to housing goes anywhere both in Seattle and other major cities.
I don&rsquo;t have a horse in this
particular race, I live near the <a href="http://premiergc.com/-jefferson-park-golf-course">Jefferson
Park course</a> and I
really appreciate the large
expanse of green it provides however I am acutely aware of the need for
more housing within Seattle city limits.</p>

<p>Interested in taking a look? I put the full data I got from the city
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/city_of_seattle_golf_counts">here</a>.</p>

			A Visual Ranking of Seattle Public Elementary Schools</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the things people consistently tell me when they are
considering buying or renting a home in a new location is
that they want to move somewhere with &ldquo;good schools.&rdquo; This always makes
me wonder how we quantify what schools are
considered &ldquo;good&rdquo;? To start you might look for information on school
reputations or performance using local school data fact sheets from
realtors or apartment managers or, more likely, by searching ranking and
review sites such as
<a href="https://www.niche.com/k12/thurgood-marshall-elementary-school-seattle-wa/">Niche</a>.
This approach is generally fine but it assumes that you are only
interested in a specific neighborhood which may be difficult to achieve
right now in most major cities across the US and especially in
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/new-home-price-records-777000-in-seattle-950000-on-the-eastside/">Seattle</a>.</p>

<p>What if instead we looked at all the neighborhood school ratings in a
city simultaneously? This would
allow the reader to spot trends and make visual comparisons as well
as possibly identify overperforming schools in unexpected areas.
Fortunately, Seattle Public Schools (SPS) provides quite a lot of
<a href="https://www.seattleschools.org/cms/One.aspx?portalId=627&amp;pageId=6369011">data</a>
about their schools which makes this easy to visualize.</p>

<h1>Setup</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>For this analysis I just the SPS data for the 2016-17 school
year.</p></li>
<li><p>I focused solely on elementary school data for the 2016-17
school year. I used the SPS district boundary map for all public elementary
schools in the City of Seattle and ignored any magnet or alternative
elementary schools.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Rankings</h1>

<p>Initially I focused on three questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What school has the best student/teacher ratio?</li>
<li>What school reports the best attendance?</li>
<li>What schools are best for reading and math?</li>
</ul>


<p>I took the SPS data for student/teacher ratio, attendance rate, and reading and math
proficiency scores for each school and calculated their rank
within the city to make this table. Click on the category name to sort
by that category.</p>

<p>What jumps out at me most is that no particular school consistently
out-performs the others, which can make it challenging to decide what
to prioritize when choosing a school.</p>

<h1>Student/Teacher ratio</h1>

<p>Each school reports the number of enrolled students and the number of
teachers which I simply used to calculate a ratio.</p>

<p><em>Click on an attendance area for the exact percentage.</em></p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/student_teacher_ratio_map.html"
height=850 width=520></iframe>


<h1>Attendance</h1>

<p>I was initially interested in student attendance data, but the elementary
school with the
lowest daily attendance was Lowell Elementary with an attendance rate of
89%. Every other school reported an attendance rate at or
above 95% which did not make for a very interesting map. I later learned
that Washington State has a compulsory
attendance <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.225">law</a>
which likely affected these numbers.</p>

<h1>Reading proficiency</h1>

<p>I was interested in looking at district-wide third grade reading achievement scores district-wide
for 3rd
graders as measured by the <a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/Assessment/StateTesting/default.aspx">Washington State proficiency
test</a>. I
chose third grade because that is the first year a Washington State standardized test is
administered for reading.</p>

<p><em>Click on an attendance area for the exact percentage.</em></p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/grade3_reading_map.html" height=850
width=520></iframe>


<h1>Math proficiency</h1>

<p>Similarly, I looked at the district-wide third grade
math achievement scores as measured by the <a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/Assessment/StateTesting/default.aspx">Washington State proficiency
test</a></p>

<p><em>Click on an attendance area for the exact percentage.</em></p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/grade3_math_map.html" height=850
width=520></iframe>


<h1>Family engagement</h1>

<p>SPS provides a parent survey with a variety of questions evaluating
parent enthusiasm and approval of Seattle schools. These survey results are not published, so I looked at how many families
completed these surveys for the 2016-17 school year.</p>

<p><em>Click on an attendance area for the exact percentage.</em></p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/family_engagement_map.html"
height=850 width=520></iframe>


<p>Even the school with the most responses reported that only 49.1% of families responded to the
survey which to me means that most families are satisfied with
their school but neither especially excited or disappointed by their school experiences.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Choosing a school is hard but ultimately it comes down to how
satisfied the parents or guardians are with the school. Schools report
on a wide array of metrics about student performance,
but performance is often an issue of secondary importance when
compared to parents&#8217; overall perception of the school quality.</p>

			Visualizing Flight Data for the 2017 Seattle Mariners</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Remember this map that Facebook created of friend connections back in
2011?</p>

<p><img
src="https://advox.globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5261568726_d51149d62c_b-800x398.jpg"
height="430" width="670" ></p>

<p>I thought it was pretty cool back then and I still
think its pretty cool. I wanted to make a similar map but was not sure
where to start. I could have done a similar visualization however I
recently quit
Facebook so I can no longer export all my friend&rsquo;s data to use for
making maps. My next thought was visualizing travel routes such as flight information. I am trying to
reduce my carbon footprint which meant I only flew five times in 2017
and have flown exactly zero times so far in 2018. Then I thought, you
know who does
fly alot? The Seattle Mariners.</p>

<p>First step was to collect all the Mariners game data, fortunately
Baseball Reference has all that data in an easily accessible <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SEA/2017-schedule-scores.shtml">HTML
table</a>.</p>

<p>Next step was to geolocate all the stadiums which can be a bit tedious.
Fortunately GitHub user
<a href="https://github.com/the55">the55</a> created a nice JSON file of all the
stadiums and put it as a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/the55/2155142">gist</a>. I was able to use an R
library called
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geosphere/">geosphere</a> for
using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine
formula</a> to calculate
the distance between two stadiums.</p>

<p>My initial attempt here:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/mariners_base.svg"></p>

<p>In order to make the image look similar to the Facebook connection map,
I ended up using this <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2011/05/11/how-to-map-connections-with-great-circles/">Flowing Data
post</a>
quite a bit to figure out how to
add the lines and change the background color:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/mariners_black_bg.svg"></p>

<p>Finally because there were so many trips from Seattle to American League
West opponents that I ended up adding a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter">noise or
jitter</a> to the stadium locations
to make the flight paths not perfectly overlap each other.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/mariners_map_with_noise.svg"></p>

<p>Looking back at this 2017 reminded me the Mariners finished 78-84 in
2017, here&rsquo;s hoping to a better season in 2018!</p>

<p>If interested, I put all the code for this analysis
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/blog-supplemental/blob/master/analysis/mariners_2017_travel_map.R">here</a></p>

			Further Analysis of the 2017-18 WA State Legislature</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is my second post looking at the data from the 2017-18 Washington
State Legislative Session. the first part of this blog can be
read
<a href="http://zachstednick.name/blog/2018/04/05/visualizing-the-2017-18-wa-state-legislature/">here</a></p>

<p>After some time looking at different bills that did pass, I started to
wonder if a bill
was more likely to pass if it had more sponsors. First I took the 647
bills passed by the Legislation and signed into law by Governor and
looked up how many co-sponsors each bill had:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/all_sponsor_counts.png"></p>

<p>Then I I took every bill that was introduced but did not become
law and counted up the sponsors for these:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/all_sponsor_counts_not_passed.png"></p>

<p>So it appears that the number of sponsors is not particulary predictive
for a bill becoming law. The three bills introduced in the Senate with
the highest number of Sponsors were:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Bill </th>
<th> Sponsor count </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Summary </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5598&amp;Year=2017">5598</a> </td>
<td> 40 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Granting relatives, including but not limited to grandparents, the right to seek visitation with a child through the courts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6037&amp;Year=2017">6037</a> </td>
<td> 28 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Concerning the uniform parentage act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5375&amp;Year=2017">5375</a> </td>
<td> 27 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Renaming the cancer research endowment authority to the Andy Hill cancer research endowment.</td>

</tbody>
</table>


<p>And in the House:</p>

<th>Bill </th>
<th> Sponsor count </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Summary </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=2282&amp;Year=2017">2282</a> </td>
<td> 52 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Protecting an open internet in Washington state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1714&amp;Year=2017">1714</a> </td>
<td> 45 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Concerning nursing staffing practices at hospitals.</td>

<td style="text-align:right;"> Creating Washington state aviation special license plates.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>In November 2017, Manka Dhingra won a special election and the
Washington State Senate
flipped from Republican held to Democrat held. Initially I wanted to
focus on the number of bills passed by a Republican held Senate versus a
Democrat held Senate but there were too many extraneous variables such
as passing a budget and a shorter session in 2018. Instead, I decided to
focus on the number of Yea votes by bill</p>

<p><img src ="http://zachstednick.com/percentage_yea_votes.png"></p>

<p>Many of the bills passed were with almost overwhelming support, which is
refreshing to see that there is quite a bit of bipartisanship in
Washington State in 2018.</p>

			Visualizing the 2017-18 WA State Legislature</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In his <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/news-media/speeches/2018-state-state">2018 State of the State
speech</a>,
Washington State Governor Jay Inslee
made a passioned appeal for a carbon tax and proposed one in Washington
State Senate bill
<a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6203&amp;Year=2017">6203</a>.
Because of this, I paid more attention to the
activities of the Washington State Legislature than I ever had before
and I found it fascinating.</p>

<p>First off, lets start with the website for the state Legislature. Here
is a screenshot of the
Washington State Legislature page for SB 6203 which is the bill I was
most interested in:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_6203.png"></p>

<p>The website is very resource dense and well worth time exploring when
the Legislature is in session. Every piece of proposed legislation
shows the same amount of information and allows you to easily find and
contact your legislators about a particular bill if interested. The site
also has livestreams of <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6203&amp;Year=2017#videoSection">committee
hearings</a>
and displays <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/far/Senate/Calendar">vote
counts</a> on bills in almost
real time as the votes are tallied on both the
Senate and the House floor.</p>

<p>Is Washington State unique in this regard? Of course not, here is a
screen shot for an interesting bill in Legislature for the State of
California.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/CA_827.png"></p>

<p>Finally here is a screenshot of a House bill on the United States
Congress website</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/HR_5031.png"></p>

<p>Does ease of use of the website increase participation in the civic
process at the state level? That is a difficult question to answer but
personally I am glad I get to use the Washington State one instead of
the California State Legislature webpage.</p>

<p>The 2017-18 Washington State Legislative Session ended on <a href="http://leg.wa.gov/legislature/Documents/2018CutoffCalendar.pdf">March 8,
2018</a>
and
Governor Inslee then had 21 days to sign bills into law or veto them.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the 2017-18 Session made me wonder what happened to
those bills that were introduced and how many of them actually became
law.
In addition to a great website, the Washington State
Legislature also has an excellent set of <a href="http://wslwebservices.leg.wa.gov/">Web
Services</a> that allow for
programmatically
capturing metrics and data about activities in the state
