    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past few years I have tried to start each New Year off by
selecting a biography as the first book I read that particular year.
I have no specific methodology as to why I choose the biographies I do,
often
it is from something tangential to the topic of the biography or just
because I am interested in the topic in general. Here are some of my
recent picks
as well as my pick for 2020:</p>

<p><strong>2016 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/15743242">Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic
Future</a></strong>
I picked up this one largely because I was interested in Elon Musk and
curious to learn more about him. This book was illuminating in regards
to how much self-confidence Musk has in himself and how much he was
willing to double down on himself how frequently that was
all he needed to move on to more stable ground.</p>

<p><strong>2017 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/8586497">Spread Spectrum</a></strong>
I was interested in reading more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr">Hedy
Lamarr</a> and this book seemed
like a great place to start. It was self-published and quite bizarre at
times but it did explain technical details quite well and was well-paced
which more than made up for the author&rsquo;s unconventional asides.</p>

<p><strong>2018 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/1653761">The Man Who Fed the World: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Norman
Borlaug and His Battle to End World
Hunger</a></strong>
I was
really interested in learning more about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug">Borlaug</a> and his
contributions to agronomy but this particular biography was sloppy and
rife with colloquialisms. Borlaug was a fascinating character who likely
saved billions of people from starvation and demands a better biography
than this one.</p>

<p><strong>2019 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/22229559">I Am Dynamite!: A Life of
Nietzsche</a></strong>
I did not initially set out to read this book as my first book of the
year. Unfortunately, the book I had
planned on reading <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/18814688">In the Great Green Room: The Brilliant and Bold Life
of Margaret Wise</a>, was so
bad
that I bailed on it and read the Nietzsche biography instead. Prior to
reading, I was aware of
Nietzsche if only because of the famous &ldquo;God is dead&rdquo; quote and
something
vaguely related to Nazism. I was fascinated to learn more about him and
how
his writings were completely reappropriated after his death. This was
one of the better books I read all year.</p>

<p>Finally, in 2020 the first book I am reading is <strong><a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/14139984">Empress Dowager Cixi:
The Concubine Who Launched Modern
China</a></strong>. Each year I try
to alternate between male and female biographies and after bailing on
the biography of Margaret Wise last year, I felt it was time to read a
female biography to start 2020. I am also interested in China and while
I realize this book might be quite revisionist am curious to learn more
about Cixi and her role in developing modern day China.</p>

    <id>http://stedy.github.io/blog/2019/05/23/impact-of-amazon-echo-on-babies-named-alexa</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, there was an article in the Seattle Times about <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/for-4-seattle-women-called-alexa-its-fun-frustrating-to-share-name-with-amazon-device/">girls
named Alexa post-introduction of the Amazon
Echo</a>.
I was chatting with a friend of mine about this and we wondered if the
introduction of the Amazon Echo has lead to a reduction in girls named
Alexa. According to Wikipedia, the Amazon Echo was first introduced on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo">November 6, 2014</a> and Hadley
Wickham was kind enough to organize an R package of baby names as
recorded by the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/babynames">United States
SSA</a>. Using this data shows a
steep decline in the number of female babies named Alexa which may be
due to a variety of factors:</p>

<p>In the process of making this first plot I realized that there are boys
in the SSA data named Alexa as well, lets see what the data for boys looks like:</p>

    <id>http://stedy.github.io/blog/2019/05/04/what-is-the-most-remote-airport-from-the-city-it-serves-in-the-united-states</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, there was a question on
<a href="https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/137558/what-is-the-most-remote-airport-from-the-center-of-the-city-it-supposedly-serves">travel.SE</a> about locating the airport furthest
from the city it is supposed to serve. There are some interesing answers
including the winner from Paris where the airport is approximately 147
km away from the Paris metro area. I started to wonder about this
question for different airports
within the US and I stumbled onto this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia page</a>
which served as a good baseline for a quick analysis.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/places/">Google Maps location
API</a> to calculate
latitude and longitude
for the center
of the town or city and location of the airport. I then used the Google
Maps directions API to calculate the driving distance between the
airport and the center of the town it serves. This lead to some
interesting edge cases. For example, Peach Springs, Arizona is on this
list and the airport is about 113 miles away:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/peach_springs_drive.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach_Springs,_Arizona">Peach Springs</a> is a Census Designated Place and largely serves the
Hualapai tribe. Should it have been included on this list?</p>

<p>I also noticed on this Wikipedia page that there are many airports with
split locations (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma_International_Airport">Sea/Tac
Airport</a>
for example)
or a single airport serving multiple locations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg_International_Airport">Harrisburg
International
Airport</a>
serving
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middletown,_Dauphin_County,_Pennsylvania">Middletown,
PA</a>).
For these cases I just used
the first city mentioned for this analysis. The Wikipedia article also
lists
enplanements as recorded by the FAA in 2015 which provides a useful
metric for comparison. First I looked
at distance to airport versus number of passengers:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/airport_all.png"></p>

<p>Not too surprising to observe that many of the airports have very few
emboardings each year and are reasonably close to the center of town.</p>

<p>Then I looked at only airports that had over one million enplanements
which narrowed my list of airports down to 27:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/airport_1mil.png"></p>

<p>To me it is interesting to note that San Diego, Boston and to some
extent Dulles are all close to the city center with relatively few
emboardings as compared to this subset. Also, I grew up in Fort Collins,
CO and have many fond memories as a child of driving across the plains
with Denver International Airport seeming so, so far away.</p>

    <link href="http://stedy.github.io/blog/2018/12/03/changes-in-voter-turnout-between-the-2014-and-2018-us-elections/"/>
    <updated>2018-12-03T22:08:34-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://stedy.github.io/blog/2018/12/03/changes-in-voter-turnout-between-the-2014-and-2018-us-elections</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I watched the livestream of the 2018 US midterm election results, I
was absolutely stunned at the significant increase in voter turnout over
the 2014 US midterm election. Now that almost all of the 2018 election
results have been certified by their repective Secretaries of State, I
wanted to take a look at how this increase in voter turnout manifested
on a state by state basis.</p>

<p>To make things as simple as I could, I primarily used the data from two
New York Times elections pages: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2014/results/house">2014 results
page</a> and the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-house-elections.html">2018 results
page</a>.</p>

<p>I realize this data may not be complete as some of the voter counts are
not fully reported for all precincts on these pages. However, the total
vote count from the 2014 data is 72,031,124 while the total vote count
from 2018 is 106,385,810 which I felt was accurate enough for the
purposes of this analysis.</p>

<p>In both elections, I primarily focused on the House of Representatives
because that was the only office for universally up for election. As I
embarked on this project I soon realized that a direct comparison would
not be possible after Pennslyvania <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania's_congressional_districts">re-drew its congressional maps in
early
2018</a>
and Florida did so as well in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida%27s_congressional_districts">2016
redistricting</a>.</p>

<p>This first map simply shows congressional districts where the voter
turnout increased. The congressional districts colored grey have either
a decline in voter turnout, or where the candidate ran uncontested in
either 2014 or 2018 (or both) and therefore do not have a difference in
percentage to measure.</p>

<p>Explorable version
<a href="http://zachstednick.com/US_house_diff_map_pos_only.html">here</a></p>

<p>The second choropleth map shows states that increased in voter turnout
as blue, states that decreased in voter turnout as red while those
colored grey had at least one uncontested election.</p>

<a href="http://zachstednick.com/house_diff_map_pos_neg.html">here</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that only seven US Congressional districts had
decreases in voter turnout from 2014 to 2018. Table of districts with
decreased voter turnout:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> District </th>
<th> 2014 votes </th>
<th> 2018 votes </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Difference</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> IL-09 </td>
<td> 203946 </td>
<td> 91476 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -55.14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> CO-01 </td>
<td> 266021 </td>
<td> 256542 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -3.56</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> PA-02 </td>
<td> 202635 </td>
<td> 197495 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -2.53</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> AK-00 </td>
<td> 242844 </td>
<td> 238131 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -1.94</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> IL-07 </td>
<td> 171502 </td>
<td> 170290 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -0.70</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> AR-04 </td>
<td> 205066 </td>
<td> 204113 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -0.46</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> KY-05 </td>
<td> 218697 </td>
<td> 218324 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> -0.17</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>The district with the highest increase in turnout? That would be
<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California's_34th_Congressional_District">CA-34</a></p>

<p>Finally I grouped all the votes together by state to make the following
choropleth of US House votes on a state level:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On September 17, 2018, the King County council <a href="https://mkcclegisearch.kingcounty.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3585391&amp;GUID=4C4DA409-D946-4189-AF23-59682F4FEF44&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search=">voted
5-4</a>
to allow for a
new funding agreement between King County and sports stadiums such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeco_Field">Safeco Field</a>. There have
already
been challenges
to the legislation and it may appear as a
<a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/residents-could-get-to-vote-whether-safeco-field-gets-its-135-million-in-county-funding">petition</a>
on the ballot soon.</p>

<p>The 2018 season was unusually successful for the Mariners, and while
they are again sitting out the Playoffs this season I did wonder what
attendance looked like this year.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Mariners_Attendance_2018.png"></p>

<p>I added two lines to this plot, one for maximum attendance (currently
47,715 according to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeco_Field#Seating_capacity">Wikipedia</a>)
and one for mean attendance which was 28,389 this year. This means that
we have a
stadium that is on average about 60% full for any game for a team that
competed for a
Playoff spot until the very end of the
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/robinson-cano-breaks-out-bat-as-mariners-score-season-high-13-runs-to-bash-rangers/">season</a>.

    <updated>2018-08-08T16:00:05-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://stedy.github.io/blog/2018/08/08/sentiment-analysis-of-candidate-statements-by-senate-candidates</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/calendar.aspx">2018 Washington State
Primary</a> was held on
August 7, 2018. As a
registered voter in Washington State I am mailed a <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/research/2018-voters-pamphlet.aspx">Voter&rsquo;s Information
Pamphlet</a>
which lists the candidates and a Candidate
Statement (provided by the candidate) for each office. The Candidate
Statement is where the candidate is allowed to write anything they want
as long as its under 300 words. I was curious if there was any
relationship between the sentiment of a candidate&rsquo;s Statement and the
number of votes
that candidate received.</p>

<p>I conducted my analysis using sentiment analysis which groups words
together based on
pre-defined lists of words that are members of that group. There are
many word groups to choose from such as &ldquo;joy&rdquo; and &ldquo;trust&rdquo; but for this
analysis I just looked at &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;negative&rdquo; words (as classified
by <a href="http://www.saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">NRC</a>).</p>

<p>Although there were many different offices up for election in this Primary,
the U.S. Senate race had 29 candidates which made for a very rich
dataset. Washington State uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary">Top-Two
Primary</a>
which allows for easy comparison across political parties.</p>

<p>There are many factors deliberately ignored by this analysis such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index">PVI</a>,
incumbency, fundraising, political party and candidate issues. However I thought
text mining could
be an interesting way to analyze these candidates in a slightly
different manner.</p>

<p>First I just plotted the number of positive words in the Candidate
Statement for each candidate:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_positive.png"></p>

<p>Then I repeated with the number of negative words in the Candidate
Statement for each candidate:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_negative.png"></p>

<p>Next I looked at the number of positive words in the Candidate Statement
by candidate versus the number of votes that candidate received. Because
of the strength of the Democratic incumbent candidate <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maria_Cantwell">Maria
Cantwell</a> and the Republican
establishment candidate <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Susan_Hutchison">Susan
Hutchison</a> I had to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">log-transform</a> the vote counts because these two candidates got so much of
the total vote.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_positive_vote_count.png"></p>

<p>Then I repeated this analysis by looking at the negative word count for
each candidate versus the total log-transformed vote count:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_candidate_negative_vote_count.png"></p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t think this will lead to any novel political insights, I
do think its an interesting way to look at candidates. Full code

    <id>http://stedy.github.io/blog/2018/07/18/should-seattle-convert-public-golf-courses-into-land-for-housing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like many other metropolitan areas, Seattle is currently dealing with a
serious housing shortage. Recently, there have been some good articles
(<a href="https://seattletransitblog.com/2018/06/11/west-seattle-can-tunnel-housing/">here</a>
and
<a href="https://fancybeans.com/2018/01/27/what-is-a-housing-emergency-really/">here</a>)
about converting public golf
courses into housing. It is an interesting concept and certainly should
be discussed, however one aspect I feel is being overlooked in this
debate
is how popular are these golf courses anyways? According to Bloomberg
News, there is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-05-25/off-for-a-round-of-golf-this-weekend-didn-t-think-so">declining interest in golf
nationwide</a>,
is this happening in
Seattle?</p>

<p>The City of Seattle is somewhat
aware of this issue and is at least discussing
<a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/ParksAndRecreation/BriefingPapers/Golf%20Park%20Board%20Briefing%20Paper%20Final%202-6-18.pdf">options</a>
for the golf courses. I filed a <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/public-records">Public Records
Request</a> act
with the City of Seattle and they sent me data on the rounds of golf
played for
the past three years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the city only provided the count data for number of
rounds of golf played per year so I cannot look at more granular trends.
However, I can plot the counts on an annual basis.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Seattle_golf_counts.png"></p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if this debate both on converting public
golf
courses to housing goes anywhere both in Seattle and other major cities.
I don&rsquo;t have a horse in this
particular race, I live near the <a href="http://premiergc.com/-jefferson-park-golf-course">Jefferson
Park course</a> and I
really appreciate the large
expanse of green it provides however I am acutely aware of the need for
more housing within Seattle city limits.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things people consistently tell me when they are
considering buying or renting a home in a new location is
that they want to move somewhere with &ldquo;good schools.&rdquo; This always makes
me wonder how we quantify what schools are
considered &ldquo;good&rdquo;? To start you might look for information on school
reputations or performance using local school data fact sheets from
realtors or apartment managers or, more likely, by searching ranking and
review sites such as
<a href="https://www.niche.com/k12/thurgood-marshall-elementary-school-seattle-wa/">Niche</a>.
This approach is generally fine but it assumes that you are only
interested in a specific neighborhood which may be difficult to achieve
right now in most major cities across the US and especially in
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/new-home-price-records-777000-in-seattle-950000-on-the-eastside/">Seattle</a>.</p>

<p>What if instead we looked at all the neighborhood school ratings in a
city simultaneously? This would
allow the reader to spot trends and make visual comparisons as well
as possibly identify overperforming schools in unexpected areas.
Fortunately, Seattle Public Schools (SPS) provides quite a lot of
<a href="https://www.seattleschools.org/cms/One.aspx?portalId=627&amp;pageId=6369011">data</a>
about their schools which makes this easy to visualize.</p>

<h1>Setup</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>For this analysis I just the SPS data for the 2016-17 school
year.</p></li>
<li><p>I focused solely on elementary school data for the 2016-17
school year. I used the SPS district boundary map for all public elementary
schools in the City of Seattle and ignored any magnet or alternative
elementary schools.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Rankings</h1>

<p>Initially I focused on three questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What school has the best student/teacher ratio?</li>
<li>What school reports the best attendance?</li>
<li>What schools are best for reading and math?</li>
</ul>


<p>I took the SPS data for student/teacher ratio, attendance rate, and reading and math
proficiency scores for each school and calculated their rank
within the city to make this table. Click on the category name to sort
by that category.</p>

<p>What jumps out at me most is that no particular school consistently
out-performs the others, which can make it challenging to decide what
to prioritize when choosing a school.</p>

<h1>Student/Teacher ratio</h1>

<p>Each school reports the number of enrolled students and the number of
teachers which I simply used to calculate a ratio.</p>

<p><em>Click on an attendance area for the exact percentage.</em></p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/student_teacher_ratio_map.html"
height=850 width=520></iframe>


<h1>Attendance</h1>

<p>I was initially interested in student attendance data, but the elementary
school with the
lowest daily attendance was Lowell Elementary with an attendance rate of
89%. Every other school reported an attendance rate at or
above 95% which did not make for a very interesting map. I later learned
that Washington State has a compulsory
attendance <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.225">law</a>
which likely affected these numbers.</p>

<h1>Reading proficiency</h1>

<p>I was interested in looking at district-wide third grade reading achievement scores district-wide
for 3rd
graders as measured by the <a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/Assessment/StateTesting/default.aspx">Washington State proficiency
test</a>. I
chose third grade because that is the first year a Washington State standardized test is
administered for reading.</p>

<p><em>Click on an attendance area for the exact percentage.</em></p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/grade3_reading_map.html" height=850
width=520></iframe>


<h1>Math proficiency</h1>

<p>Similarly, I looked at the district-wide third grade
math achievement scores as measured by the <a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/Assessment/StateTesting/default.aspx">Washington State proficiency
test</a></p>

<p><em>Click on an attendance area for the exact percentage.</em></p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/grade3_math_map.html" height=850
width=520></iframe>


<h1>Family engagement</h1>

<p>SPS provides a parent survey with a variety of questions evaluating
parent enthusiasm and approval of Seattle schools. These survey results are not published, so I looked at how many families
completed these surveys for the 2016-17 school year.</p>

<p><em>Click on an attendance area for the exact percentage.</em></p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/family_engagement_map.html"
height=850 width=520></iframe>


<p>Even the school with the most responses reported that only 49.1% of families responded to the
survey which to me means that most families are satisfied with
their school but neither especially excited or disappointed by their school experiences.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Choosing a school is hard but ultimately it comes down to how
satisfied the parents or guardians are with the school. Schools report
on a wide array of metrics about student performance,
but performance is often an issue of secondary importance when
compared to parents&#8217; overall perception of the school quality.</p>

    <updated>2018-05-26T17:11:21-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://stedy.github.io/blog/2018/05/26/visualizing-flight-data-for-the-2017-seattle-mariners</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Remember this map that Facebook created of friend connections back in
2011?</p>

<p><img
src="https://advox.globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5261568726_d51149d62c_b-800x398.jpg"
height="430" width="670" ></p>

<p>I thought it was pretty cool back then and I still
think its pretty cool. I wanted to make a similar map but was not sure
where to start. I could have done a similar visualization however I
recently quit
Facebook so I can no longer export all my friend&rsquo;s data to use for
making maps. My next thought was visualizing travel routes such as flight information. I am trying to
reduce my carbon footprint which meant I only flew five times in 2017
and have flown exactly zero times so far in 2018. Then I thought, you
know who does
fly alot? The Seattle Mariners.</p>

<p>First step was to collect all the Mariners game data, fortunately
Baseball Reference has all that data in an easily accessible <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SEA/2017-schedule-scores.shtml">HTML
table</a>.</p>

<p>Next step was to geolocate all the stadiums which can be a bit tedious.
Fortunately GitHub user
<a href="https://github.com/the55">the55</a> created a nice JSON file of all the
stadiums and put it as a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/the55/2155142">gist</a>. I was able to use an R
library called
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geosphere/">geosphere</a> for
using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine
formula</a> to calculate
the distance between two stadiums.</p>

<p>My initial attempt here:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/mariners_base.svg"></p>

<p>In order to make the image look similar to the Facebook connection map,
I ended up using this <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2011/05/11/how-to-map-connections-with-great-circles/">Flowing Data
post</a>
quite a bit to figure out how to
add the lines and change the background color:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/mariners_black_bg.svg"></p>

<p>Finally because there were so many trips from Seattle to American League
West opponents that I ended up adding a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter">noise or
jitter</a> to the stadium locations
to make the flight paths not perfectly overlap each other.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/mariners_map_with_noise.svg"></p>

<p>Looking back at this 2017 reminded me the Mariners finished 78-84 in
2017, here&rsquo;s hoping to a better season in 2018!</p>

<p>If interested, I put all the code for this analysis

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my second post looking at the data from the 2017-18 Washington
State Legislative Session. the first part of this blog can be

<p>After some time looking at different bills that did pass, I started to
wonder if a bill
was more likely to pass if it had more sponsors. First I took the 647
bills passed by the Legislation and signed into law by Governor and
looked up how many co-sponsors each bill had:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/all_sponsor_counts.png"></p>

<p>Then I I took every bill that was introduced but did not become
law and counted up the sponsors for these:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/all_sponsor_counts_not_passed.png"></p>

<p>So it appears that the number of sponsors is not particulary predictive
for a bill becoming law. The three bills introduced in the Senate with
the highest number of Sponsors were:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Bill </th>
<th> Sponsor count </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Summary </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5598&amp;Year=2017">5598</a> </td>
<td> 40 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Granting relatives, including but not limited to grandparents, the right to seek visitation with a child through the courts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6037&amp;Year=2017">6037</a> </td>
<td> 28 </td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5375&amp;Year=2017">5375</a> </td>
<td> 27 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Renaming the cancer research endowment authority to the Andy Hill cancer research endowment.</td>

<p>And in the House:</p>

<p>In November 2017, Manka Dhingra won a special election and the
Washington State Senate
flipped from Republican held to Democrat held. Initially I wanted to
focus on the number of bills passed by a Republican held Senate versus a
Democrat held Senate but there were too many extraneous variables such
as passing a budget and a shorter session in 2018. Instead, I decided to
focus on the number of Yea votes by bill</p>

<p><img src ="http://zachstednick.com/percentage_yea_votes.png"></p>

<p>Many of the bills passed were with almost overwhelming support, which is
refreshing to see that there is quite a bit of bipartisanship in
Washington State in 2018.</p>

<a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6203&amp;Year=2017">6203</a>.
Because of this, I paid more attention to the
activities of the Washington State Legislature than I ever had before
and I found it fascinating.</p>

<p>First off, lets start with the website for the state Legislature. Here
is a screenshot of the
Washington State Legislature page for SB 6203 which is the bill I was
most interested in:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/WA_6203.png"></p>

<p>The website is very resource dense and well worth time exploring when
the Legislature is in session. Every piece of proposed legislation
shows the same amount of information and allows you to easily find and
contact your legislators about a particular bill if interested. The site
also has livestreams of <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6203&amp;Year=2017#videoSection">committee
hearings</a>
and displays <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/far/Senate/Calendar">vote
counts</a> on bills in almost
real time as the votes are tallied on both the
Senate and the House floor.</p>

<p>Is Washington State unique in this regard? Of course not, here is a
screen shot for an interesting bill in Legislature for the State of
California.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/CA_827.png"></p>

<p>Finally here is a screenshot of a House bill on the United States
Congress website</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/HR_5031.png"></p>

<p>Does ease of use of the website increase participation in the civic
process at the state level? That is a difficult question to answer but
personally I am glad I get to use the Washington State one instead of
the California State Legislature webpage.</p>

<p>The 2017-18 Washington State Legislative Session ended on <a href="http://leg.wa.gov/legislature/Documents/2018CutoffCalendar.pdf">March 8,
2018</a>
and
Governor Inslee then had 21 days to sign bills into law or veto them.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the 2017-18 Session made me wonder what happened to
those bills that were introduced and how many of them actually became
law.
In addition to a great website, the Washington State
Legislature also has an excellent set of <a href="http://wslwebservices.leg.wa.gov/">Web
Services</a> that allow for
programmatically
capturing metrics and data about activities in the state
legislation. One way to easily visualize this is with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">Sankey
Diagram</a> (no relation to
this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Iec080MWCs">Sankey</a> though).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following up on my earlier
<a href="http://zachstednick.name/blog/2016/09/02/has-the-pac-12-network-decreased-uw-home-football-game-attendance/">post</a>,
how much has the Pac-12 Network affected game attendance? I updated my previous data set to include the past two seasons so as to include 2008-2017 data. I relied on home game
attendance as reported by Wikipedia and also used Wikipedia to determine what TV network broadcast each home game. In an ideal world I would be able to make better comparisons using the <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/solutions/measurement/television.html">Nielsen rating</a>
for each game however my guess is that data does not come as cheap or as
easily as data from Wikipedia. For the purposes of this analysis I am
neglecting various other factors in this anaysis
such as time at kickoff, game day temperature, opponent, ranking of UW,
ranking of opponent, etc&hellip; the list goes on and on. My main intention
was
to simply show home game attendance versus TV network for all games:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/UW_football_attendance_by_TV_2008-17.png"></p>

<p>And attendance for Pac-12 only opponents versus TV network:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/UW_football_attendance_by_TV_2008-17_Pac12_only.png"></p>

<p>Based on the available data it appears that attendance during home games
has
been influenced and possibly decreased by the Pac-12 Network but it is
difficult to say for sure while ignoring so many external factors. With
a significant budget deficit still a major
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/uw-regents-assail-ex-athletic-director-over-growing-deficit/">issue</a>,
one can only hope that losses from game day ticket sales are made up for
with Pac-12 Network advertising revenue.</p>

    <link href="http://stedy.github.io/blog/2017/10/07/states-with-multiple-football-teams-in-the-ap-top-25/"/>
    <updated>2017-10-07T22:24:34-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://stedy.github.io/blog/2017/10/07/states-with-multiple-football-teams-in-the-ap-top-25</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400935292">WSU beating
Oregon</a> and
<a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400935293">UW beating UC
Berkeley</a>,
the State of Washington is poised to have two football teams in the top
ten of NCAA Division I football rankings. Naturally this got me
thinking, how often does this happen and how many states have had this
same achievement?</p>

<p>To answer this I used the weekly results of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Poll">Associated Press
poll</a> which started in 1936 and
thanks to our good friends at <a href="https://donate.wikimedia.org">Wikipedia</a>,
I was able to get AP Poll results for every week.</p>

<p>I found that 25 states had at least one week where two teams from that
state were in the AP Poll. However, the more I thought about it the more
I realized this was slightly biased because some states might only have
one team (i.e. Wyoming) while other states might have two Division I
teams that are never both great at the same time (i.e. Montana). I
tightened down my restrictions a bit and only looked at the top 10 teams
from each AP Poll.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, of the 25 states with at least two teams in the AP top 25
Poll,
21 of those states had a week with at least two teams from that state in the AP top 10.
I made a summary table with the most recent year each state achieved
this distinction listed:</p>

continuing to look at using linear
regression for determining the best
episodes of a TV show to watch. I started to think about how to look at
this data for multiple TV shows. Performing a linear regression on show
rating by episode number within a season quickly allows us to determine
the maximum and minimum residual for all the show episodes. I took this
a step further and
calculated which episode of the show it was. For example, here are all
the episodes with residual value for that particular show <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4635276/">Master of
None</a>:</p>

<p>We can see that the episode with the highest residual is S2E1 &ldquo;The
Thief&rdquo; and the episode with the lowest residual is S2E7 &ldquo;Door #3&rdquo;. For
every TV show I took all the episodes and calculated their order as a percent of
the total number of episodes - for example the pilot episode would be 0.0 and the
series
finale would be 1.0 to generate an index. I then took the
maximum and minimum residual values for each show and plotted them
against that episode. For example here is a plot of just Master of None:</p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/mon_min_max.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="height:500px; width:800px;" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>To obtain data on as many shows as I could I used this <a href="http://www.imdb.com/search/title?at=0&amp;num_votes=5000,&amp;sort=user_rating,de">IMDb
list</a>
of shows with over 5000 votes and selected the first 1200 shows as a
dataset. I then reused the <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb API</a> as I did before. I then calculated the same values as I did for Master of None
above and plotted them in a similar manner (use the mouseover for more
information on each point):</p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/imdb_min_max.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="height:500px; width:800px;" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>Two things immediately jump out at me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The density of points right around the zero line shows that linear
regression is a pretty good metric to use for this type of analysis and
that most people rate the show generally in line with the overall trend
for that particular season.</p></li>
<li><p>There seems to be a tendancy for people to really love or really hate
the series finale of TV shows and this shows up by the sheer number of
points at 1. Possibly this is people expressing their overall view of
the show as a whole or maybe people really were really happy or unhappy
with the series finale.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I put some of the main code I used in a <a href="https://github.com/stedy/blog-supplemental">GitHub

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am not much of a binge watcher but I do enjoy quality TV shows which
is why I think <a href="http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/">GraphTV</a> is so
great. GraphTV plots the IMDb user ratings for every episode
and then performs a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">linear regression</a> of
the episode rating by the episode number to create a trend line which
helps you see if the show gets better or worse over the course of the
season.</p>

<p>This is nice but it can get difficult to use GraphTV for shows like
<a href="http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/tt0088526">Golden Girls</a> and
downright impossible for shows like <a href="http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/tt0096697">The
Simpsons</a>.</p>

<p>To solve this I created a GitHub repo
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/binge-trendy">binge-trendy</a>. Because the trend
line is fit to the IMDb user rating data, we are
interested in which episodes do IMDb users think are better than the
regression model predicts which translates to any deviation from the
trend line. Since I am only interested in episodes that are
rated higher than the regression model would have predicted,
I only look at episodes with a positive residual.</p>

<p>For example, Golden Girls season 4</p>

<p>I realize the code is not great,
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint">pylint</a> currently gives it a 6.05 but if there is
one thing I have learned in software:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Currently there are many political issues that demand
attention however in my opinion there are none that would affect more
people than the possible destruction of net neutrality.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">Net neutrality</a> is simply the principle that all data on the internet
should be treated the same. It does not matter if you are visiting Fox
News or Mother Jones - the data and content from both of these
websites (as well as from every other website) should be treated as
equal and that data should be served equally by all Internet Service Providers. Losing net neutrality could
lead to an internet that favors
one of these two sites based on which site is willing to pay more. I
chose these sites because they are such polar opposites but at the same
time we live in a country that allows for such opposites to
have equal protection of freedom of speech. I may disagree with the content of a particular
website but
I do not think it should be served any differently than the website of a
site I do agree with. Destruction of net neutrality will lead to greater
influence wielded by larger corporations and could
stifle smaller websites and startups.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is still time to act. On July 12, various online
communities and users will come together to stand tall and sound the
alarm about the FCC&rsquo;s attack on net neutrality. Join us

    <id>http://stedy.github.io/blog/2017/03/26/pronto-post-mortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pronto bike share ends this Friday March 31st and I will miss it for
sure. I <a href="http://zachstednick.name/blog/2016/02/09/thoughts-on-pronto/">wrote about why Pronto mattered to me</a> and I
even rode a Pronto bike in the 25
mile <a href="http://www.obliteride.org/">Obliteride</a> last year:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/IMG_2260.JPG"></p>

<p>In October 2015, there was a Pronto sponsored
<a href="https://www.prontocycleshare.com/datachallenge">contest</a> to visualize
bikeshare ride data. I created an
<a href="http://prontostories.com/">entry</a> which although did not win, was a
nice introduction for me to learn mapping with
<a href="d3js.org">D3</a>. As I was
checking out the Pronto site one last time today I noticed that they had
updated their publically available dataset to include 2016
ride data as well as the 2015 ride data.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/pronto_historical_ridership.png"></p>

<p>To me it seems that Pronto had a hard time expanding and encouraging
repeat riders. Unfortunately we do not have the membership data but if
we can assume that people who did not ride much in 2015 did not renew
their membership in 2016 then it looks pretty clear that Pronto was hurting
more than people thought. Also, it looked like they had good success in
2015 with getting people to buy day passes especially during peak tourist
season in the summer and were able to replicate that success in 2016. I
feel there is a need for a dedicated
bike share in Seattle however this iteration of bike share does not
appear to be the solution we need.</p>

<p>I went back to the Pronto site to fetch all my data because of an idea I
worked on then abandoned last summer. The idea was for a website that
was basically <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> for Pronto
whereby you compared your ride time data to everyone else&rsquo;s and mapped out how
fast you were compared to them. Pronto did not make it easy to download
all your trip data so I ended up having to write a webscraper to get out
my own data (Hint, hint Pronto 2.0!) which I put at this <a href="https://github.com/stedy/pronto-scraper">GitHub
repository</a>. I never was able
to get my project past the personal level and my ultimate goal was to
simply make a map of the route and add
in plots. Here is an example of all trips from Fairview Ave N &amp; Ward St
to Westlake Ave &amp; 6th Ave:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sad that I can&rsquo;t work on this project anymore but maybe with Pronto
2.0 I will be able to revist this idea.</p>

    <id>http://stedy.github.io/blog/2017/03/07/have-there-been-more-upsets-in-the-ncaa-tournament-recently</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament">NCAA Men&rsquo;s Basketball
Tournament</a>
for as long
as I can remember and with Selection Sunday coming up, I wondered if
there
have been more or less upsets in recent tournaments. To look at this
visually I used a hypothetical perfect bracket as a reference (i.e. #1
seed beats #16 seed, #2 seed beats #15 seed all the way to #1 seed beating a #2 seed). I
took the sum of all the winning seed numbers at each round in the
Regional Tournament and used that as the denominator
for comparison with the other Regional Tournaments for that particular
year.</p>

<p>I went back in time as far as I could but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NCAA_Division_I_Men's_Basketball_Tournament">2007
Tournament</a>
finally harmonized the names of the Regional tournaments with the names
East, West, South, and
Midwest which made for easier comparison across years.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/NCAA_by_region.png"></p>

<p>Clearly there have been quite a lot of upsets in the past ten years
especially within the Midwest Region.</p>

<p>I then went back and looked at all games back to 1985 when
the Tournament first expanded to 64 teams. For this I did not have all
the Regional Tournament information so I just looked at all the games
(except the Final Four).</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/NCAA_all_by_year.png"></p>

<p>The aggregate data is pretty volatile year over year as well with a low
in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NCAA_Division_I_Men's_Basketball_Tournament">2007</a>. If anything, this shows we should be in for another great year of NCAA tournament basketball complete with some (hopefully many) exciting upsets.</p>

    <updated>2017-03-02T15:15:33-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://stedy.github.io/blog/2017/03/02/a-forgotten-cron-job-leads-to-interesting-results</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On January 1, 2016 I set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> job to perform a daily count of the number of Twitter followers of the two main Gubernatorial candidates in Washington State: <a href="https://twitter.com/GovInslee">Jay Inslee</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BillBryantWA">Bill Bryant</a>. I was not attempting to predict the election or do anything with the data, I just wanted to count followers until Election Day 2016 and hopefully plot some interesting results. I checked on Election Day and the trend lines remained pretty much the same as they did at the start of the year so I abandonded my idea. Today I was cleaning out my crontab file and I found that the cron job was still running. I added a solid line for the 2016 Election Day and dashed line for the 2017 Presidential Inauguration.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Inslee_vs_Bryant.png"></p>

<p>To me, the follower count data after the inauguration is the most interesting but it is just count data and I am not sure how much you can really read into it. If anything, forgetting the cron job was a pleasant surprise that reminded me of this guy who took a screenshot of the New York Times frontpage everyday for 5 years <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCKGOiauJCE">YouTube</a>.</p>
