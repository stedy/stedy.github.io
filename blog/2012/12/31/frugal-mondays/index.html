	<div class="entry-content"><p>My 2012 resolution was to attempt to avoid spending any money on
Mondays. <strong>tldr:</strong> I came nowhere close to that goal but it was
interesting.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>In 2010, I was slightly annoyed by Amazon deciding to stop hosting
WikiLeaks
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/03/us-wikileaks-amazon-idUSTRE6B05EK20101203">website</a>
so I made it a challenge to avoid buying anything off Amazon in 2011.
It was difficult especially for all those little things such as odd
batteries or MP3 albums from obscure music groups.  This year I decided
to step up the challenge, instead of trying to avoid spending any money
on Amazon - I would try to avoid spending any money at all on Mondays.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>My only rule was no spending physical money in the form of cash or card
and no spending money online.  I allowed Monday holidays and Mondays I was on a
work trip or vacation day to be exempted.  The hours were from 12 am
Monday morning until midnight Monday night.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>I would estimate that I was successful in about &frac34; weeks per month on
average and probably 40 Mondays for the entire year.</p>

<p>The two biggest things I noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This did not really affect my spending on larger items.  I noticed
that if it was something that I wanted that was more substantial than
just coffee I would have no qualms waiting a day to purchase it.  Most
of the purchases I did not make were for things I could spend less on
such as trips to the coffee shop.</p></li>
<li><p>I felt more focused on Mondays.  With no option to take a break and
walk to the coffee shop or wonder about where to eat lunch, I was able to keep my
head down and get some good work done.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Looking ahead, I will continue to avoid spending money on Mondays
because I find it to be an interesting challenge and anything that can
help me stay focused is highly welcome in my life.</p>
