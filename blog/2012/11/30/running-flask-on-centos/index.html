	<div class="entry-content"><h1>Notes on installing my flask app on CentOS</h1>

<p>I developed a small <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">flask</a> application at work and put it on a server
running CentOS which I ended up spending a few days struggling with
getting it up and running.  Hopefully this helps someone else
avoid some of the pain I had.  Jumping right in, the first thing I did
was install flask, since CentOS 6.3 comes with python 2.6.6 it was easy to
install pip-python and use that to get flask.  Since the server was
running Apache 2.2, I put my webapp in /var/www/html. Next step was to
install httpd_devel and mod_wsgi both of which easily installed from
source.  Everything seemed fine but I kept getting an HTTP 500 error
message, here is what I did:</p>

<p>There was a lot of editing of /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to allow for vitrual hosts.<br/>
This was also the first time I had worked on a subdomain but my DNS had supposedly been setup correctly.</p>

<h2>Is mod_wsgi in the right place?</h2>

<p>Check that mod_wsgi.so is in /usr/lib/httpd/modules a</p>

<p><code>-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 315812 Sep  4 10:20 mod_wsgi.so</code></p>

<p>The <code>.</code> at the end of the permissions field is the SELinux (in this case
CentOS) ACL.</p>

<h2>Does the application have SE Linux permissions?</h2>

<p><code>bash: semanage: comand not found</code></p>

<p>Since semanage is not found I am assume that we are running CentOS
without any additional security.</p>

<h2>Are we loading mod_wsgi correctly?</h2>

<p>Add a line to httpd.conf</p>

<p><code>LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so</code></p>

<h2>Is the socket file set up correctly?</h2>

<p>Socket file not able to write to directory, set socket file to write to
/tmp using WSGISocketPrefix to allow www-data worker process to connect.</p>

<h2>Server still giving HTTP 500</h2>

<p>This is where I started trying everything I could thinkof.  I set
LogLevel to debug and later set LogLevel to info and still could not
figure out what was going on. I even asked on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12416532/mod-wsgi-test-wsgi-runs-fine-application-gives-http-500">stack
overflow</a>
with little luck.</p>

<h2>Solved!</h2>

<p>Basically, I was not explicit enough in my file path names which caused the majority of these headaches.  I assumed that CentOS would be like
Debian in how it parsed filepaths, however this was wrong and this
caused more headaches than needed.  Since this was a python application,
you would think that I would recall from the Zen of Python that
&ldquo;Explicit is better than implicit&rdquo; but in this case you would be wrong.
remember the Zen of Python</p>
