	<h2 class="title">The First Book of the Year Is Always a Biography</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>For the past few years I have tried to start each New Year off by
selecting a biography as the first book I read that particular year.
I have no specific methodology as to why I choose the biographies I do,
often
it is from something tangential to the topic of the biography or just
because I am interested in the topic in general. Here are some of my
recent picks
as well as my pick for 2020:</p>

<p><strong>2016 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/15743242">Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic
Future</a></strong></p>

<p>I picked up this one largely because I was interested in Elon Musk and
curious to learn more about him. This book was illuminating in regards
to how much self-confidence Musk has in himself and how much he was
willing to double down on himself and how frequently that was
all he needed to move on to more stable ground.</p>

<p><strong>2017 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/8586497">Spread Spectrum</a></strong></p>

<p>I was interested in reading more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr">Hedy
Lamarr</a> and this book seemed
like a great place to start. It was self-published and quite bizarre at
times but it did explain technical details quite well and was well-paced
which more than made up for the author&rsquo;s unconventional asides.</p>

<p><strong>2018 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/1653761">The Man Who Fed the World: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Norman
Borlaug and His Battle to End World
Hunger</a></strong></p>

<p>I was
really interested in learning more about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug">Borlaug</a> and his
contributions to agronomy but this particular biography was sloppy and
rife with colloquialisms. Borlaug was a fascinating character who likely
saved billions of people from starvation and demands a better biography
than this one.</p>

<p><strong>2019 - <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/22229559">I Am Dynamite!: A Life of
Nietzsche</a></strong></p>

<p>I did not initially set out to read this book as my first book of the
year. Unfortunately, the book I had
planned on reading, <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/18814688">In the Great Green Room: The Brilliant and Bold Life
of Margaret Wise</a>, was so
bad
that I bailed on it and read the Nietzsche biography instead. Prior to
reading, I was aware of
Nietzsche if only because of the famous &ldquo;God is dead&rdquo; quote and
something
vaguely related to Nazism. I was fascinated to learn more about him and
how
his writings were completely reappropriated after his death. This was
one of the better books I read all year.</p>

<p>Finally, in 2020 the first book I am reading is <strong><a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/14139984">Empress Dowager Cixi:
The Concubine Who Launched Modern
China</a></strong>. Each year I try
to alternate between male and female biographies and after bailing on
the biography of Margaret Wise last year, I felt it was time to read a
female biography to start 2020. I am also quite interested in China and while
I realize this book might be quite revisionist am curious to learn more
about Cixi and her role in developing modern day China.</p>
