    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The University of Washington Husky football team is taking on Rutgers
this Saturday with kickoff at 11 AM PST. This is awfully early to start a game, especially a game that occurs during Labor Day weekend. The game is being aired on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Network">Pac-12 Network</a> which is about to enter its fifth year of operation. This made me wonder, with the presence of the Pac-12 Network, has attendance decreased at home UW football games?</p>

<p>Fortunately, Wikipedia lists game attendance which allows for a quick
overview of UW home games stratified by network:</p>

<p>The purple dots are UW home games shown on the Pac-12 network, not
entirely convincing but at first glance they don&rsquo;t look too great for
the network. I then looked at only home Pac-10/Pac-12 games and looked at attendance
by season:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/UW_football_total_attendance.png"></p>

<p>That high point in this figure is UW versus Oregon in 2013 while that particularly low point in 2015 was versus Arizona on Halloween
which happened to fall on a Thursday in 2015. Why some executive at FS1 thought it would be a good idea to schedule a game then is beyond me.</p>

<p>In 2012, UW played its home games at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CenturyLink_Field">CenturyLink
Field</a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husky_Stadium">Husky
Stadium</a> was renovated. For the 2013 season the UW football team returned to play at a smaller Husky
Stadium, did either of these factors impact attendance?</p>

<p>Not really, there is a minimal difference in stadium size which is
reflected in this identical-looking figure.</p>

<p>What Pac-12 opponents were the biggest draws on average?</p>

<p>Obviously there are a lot of factors that can&rsquo;t be captured by game
attendance alone but with a significant budget deficit largely blamed on
<a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-huskies/uw-athletic-department-projects-budget-deficit-of-14-million-for-2016-fiscal-year/">reduced
attendance</a>, it seems like it might be time for the UW to analyze if the Pac-12 Network has really been worth the investments to date.</p>
