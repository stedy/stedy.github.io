named Alexa post-introduction of the Amazon
Echo</a>.
I was chatting with a friend of mine about this and we wondered if the
introduction of the Amazon Echo has lead to a reduction in girls named
Alexa. According to Wikipedia, the Amazon Echo was first introduced on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo">November 6, 2014</a> and Hadley
Wickham was kind enough to organize an R package of baby names as
recorded by the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/babynames">United States
SSA</a>. Using this data shows a
steep decline in the number of female babies named Alexa which may be
due to a variety of factors:</p>

in the SSA data named Alexa as well, lets see what the data for boys looks like:</p>
