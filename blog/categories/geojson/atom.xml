    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Open Street Map (OSM) is, simply put, a freely available and editable
map of the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">world</a>. I have been interested in
improving the availability of <a href="https://github.com/openseattle/seattle-boundaries">boundaries in Seattle</a> and wanted
to add park boundaries to this list as well. It was easy to look up
boundaries on OSM, for example <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/53600070">Salmon Bay Park</a> shows the various nodes that
make up its boundaries. But I had struggled with how to automate this
search since at last count Seattle had over <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/listall.asp">400
parks</a>. After months of
struggling with the OSM API, I fortuitously stumbed
across the following tweet:</p>

<p>This tweet lead me to Mapzen which provides a service called <a href="https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/">Metro
Extracts</a> which provides
datasets from OSM on a weekly basis. I downloaded the OSM2PGSQL GeoJSON
file for Seattle which provided me files for Line, Point, and
Polygon geometries. I then used
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ogr2ogr">ogr2ogr</a> to filter for parks
only with the command</p>

<p><code>ogr2ogr select 'osm_id, name, geometry' where "leisure = 'park'"</code></p>

<p>This produced a GeoJSON file that looked like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/stedy/d11ab757400fd5375796.js"></script>


<p>Obviously, more filtering needed to be done. Since many of these parks
were not in Seattle, I used the Nominatim API to search for each park
based on the OSM ID number. For example, the above mentioned park Salmon
Bay Park returns a nicely formatted <a href="http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/lookup?osm_ids=W53600070">XML
file</a> which
I just filtered based on city.</p>

<p>Even after this there were still parks that were wrongly labelled as
being in Seattle. I loaded the file into R and subset based on OSM ID
and then used
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/">rgdal</a> to write the
final result out as a GeoJSON file.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/stedy/1ef0a40bc8c29f7412a0.js"></script>


<p>The take home lesson for me is that OSM is an excellent service but as
with any publicly annotated dataset be prepared to invest some time
into cleaning and validating the data.</p>
