2011?</p>

<p>I thought it was pretty cool back then and I still
think its pretty cool. I wanted to make a similar map but was not sure
where to start. I could have done a similar visualization however I
recently quit
Facebook so I can no longer export all my friend&rsquo;s data to use for
making maps. My next thought was visualizing travel routes such as flight information. I am trying to
reduce my carbon footprint which meant I only flew five times in 2017
and have flown exactly zero times so far in 2018. Then I thought, you
know who does
fly alot? The Seattle Mariners.</p>

<p>First step was to collect all the Mariners game data, fortunately
Baseball Reference has all that data in an easily accessible <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SEA/2017-schedule-scores.shtml">HTML
table</a>.</p>

<p>Next step was to geolocate all the stadiums which can be a bit tedious.
Fortunately GitHub user
<a href="https://github.com/the55">the55</a> created a nice JSON file of all the
stadiums and put it as a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/the55/2155142">gist</a>. I was able to use an R
library called
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geosphere/">geosphere</a> for
using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine
formula</a> to calculate
the distance between two stadiums.</p>

<p>My initial attempt here:</p>

<p>In order to make the image look similar to the Facebook connection map,
I ended up using this <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2011/05/11/how-to-map-connections-with-great-circles/">Flowing Data
post</a>
quite a bit to figure out how to
add the lines and change the background color:</p>

<p>Finally because there were so many trips from Seattle to American League
West opponents that I ended up adding a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter">noise or
jitter</a> to the stadium locations
to make the flight paths not perfectly overlap each other.</p>

<p>Looking back at this 2017 reminded me the Mariners finished 78-84 in
2017, here&rsquo;s hoping to a better season in 2018!</p>

<p>If interested, I put all the code for this analysis
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/blog-supplemental/blob/master/analysis/mariners_2017_travel_map.R">here</a></p>
