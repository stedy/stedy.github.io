    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately I have been listening to episodes of <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American
Life</a> faster than they are making them
which means I have been going back to the archive for past unheard shows. Their website has a nice <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/user/login">user section</a> where you can log in and mark episodes you have heard and your favorites. The archives are arranged by year which naturally got me thinking about the number episodes I have listened to by year. A search of GitHub revealed many libraries for downloading episodes of the podcast but none that were interested in user statistics so I decided to write my own library. I am still very much beginner level with technologies such as passing cookies and CSRF requests which is why I ultimately ended up using <a href="https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Splinter</a> which just lets you automate browser actions. I used that to login and navigate the TAL archives by year. I then used <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> to parse the HTML. Finally, I just wanted to visualize the results so I used Mike Bostock&rsquo;s <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304">D3 Bar Chart example</a>.</p>

<p>Pretty basic but it gets the job done, full code here on
