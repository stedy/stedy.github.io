    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally got around to reading <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/13493349">Poor
Numbers</a> by <a href="http://mortenjerven.com/">Morton
Jerven</a> and found it really interesting. Basically Jerven argues that
academic literature has either &ldquo;neglected the issue of data quality and
therefore accepted the data at face value or dismissed the data as
unreliable and therefore irrelevant&rdquo; and this causes many issues with
the more data-driven approach to international aid in recent years.</p>

<p>The key table in this book was (in my opinion) a largely inscrutable table that showed
African economies ranked by per capita GDP with data from three
different sources of national income data: the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development
Indicators</a>,
<a href="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm">Angus
Maddison</a>, and
<a href="http://www.rug.nl/research/ggdc/data/pwt/">Penn World Tables</a>. The
differences in the rankings is hard to parse in a table but  would
theoretically lend
themselves well to a slopegraph originally proposed by Edward Tufte in
<a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/7983">The Visual Display of Quantitative
Information</a></p>

<p>Although not a true slopeplot, I was able to use a combination of
<code>geom_line</code> from ggplot2 and the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/directlabels/">directlabels
package</a> to
generate the following plot (which I will admit is a bit of a hack):</p>

<p>I was mainly interested in observing the variation in the top ten or so
countries which this plot handles well. The remaining 35 or so countries
are difficult to tell apart mostly due to very large differences in GDP.
A log transformed plot shows that
there is generally more consistency within the different rating agencies
but some variation between them.</p>

<p>Slopegraphs are an effective and efficient way to visualize this type of data which
is odd because I feel like they are rarely used and only barely
mentioned in Tufte&rsquo;s works. Hopefully more people being exposed to them
will result in further usage.</p>
