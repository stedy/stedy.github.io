    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I watched the livestream of the 2018 US midterm election results, I
was absolutely stunned at the significant increase in voter turnout over
the 2014 US midterm election. Now that almost all of the 2018 election
results have been certified by their repective Secretaries of State, I
wanted to take a look at how this increase in voter turnout manifested
on a state by state basis.</p>

<p>To make things as simple as I could, I primarily used the data from two
New York Times elections pages: the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2014/results/house">2014 results
page</a> and the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-house-elections.html">2018 results
page</a>.</p>

<p>I realize this data may not be complete as some of the voter counts are
not fully reported for all precincts on these pages. However, the total
vote count from the 2014 data is 72,031,124 while the total vote count
from 2018 is 106,385,810 which I felt was accurate enough for the
purposes of this analysis.</p>

<p>In both elections, I primarily focused on the House of Representatives
because that was the only office for universally up for election. As I
embarked on this project I soon realized that a direct comparison would
not be possible after Pennslyvania <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania's_congressional_districts">re-drew its congressional maps in
early
2018</a>
and Florida did so as well in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida%27s_congressional_districts">2016
redistricting</a>.</p>

<p>This first map simply shows congressional districts where the voter
turnout increased. The congressional districts colored grey have either
a decline in voter turnout, or where the candidate ran uncontested in
either 2014 or 2018 (or both) and therefore do not have a difference in
percentage to measure.</p>

<p>The second choropleth map shows states that increased in voter turnout
as blue, states that decreased in voter turnout as red while those
colored grey had at least one uncontested election.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that only seven US Congressional districts had
decreases in voter turnout from 2014 to 2018. Table of districts with
decreased voter turnout:</p>

<p>The district with the highest increase in turnout? That would be
<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California's_34th_Congressional_District">CA-34</a></p>

<p>Finally I grouped all the votes together by state to make the following
choropleth of US House votes on a state level:</p>
