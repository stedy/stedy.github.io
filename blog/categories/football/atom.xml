    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following up on my earlier
<a href="http://zachstednick.name/blog/2016/09/02/has-the-pac-12-network-decreased-uw-home-football-game-attendance/">post</a>,
how much has the Pac-12 Network affected game attendance? I updated my previous data set to include the past two seasons so as to include 2008-2017 data. I relied on home game
attendance as reported by Wikipedia and also used Wikipedia to determine what TV network broadcast each home game. In an ideal world I would be able to make better comparisons using the <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/solutions/measurement/television.html">Nielsen rating</a>
for each game however my guess is that data does not come as cheap or as
easily as data from Wikipedia. For the purposes of this analysis I am
neglecting various other factors in this anaysis
such as time at kickoff, game day temperature, opponent, ranking of UW,
ranking of opponent, etc&hellip; the list goes on and on. My main intention
was
to simply show home game attendance versus TV network for all games:</p>

<p>And attendance for Pac-12 only opponents versus TV network:</p>

<p>Based on the available data it appears that attendance during home games
has
been influenced and possibly decreased by the Pac-12 Network but it is
difficult to say for sure while ignoring so many external factors. With
a significant budget deficit still a major
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/uw-regents-assail-ex-athletic-director-over-growing-deficit/">issue</a>,
one can only hope that losses from game day ticket sales are made up for
with Pac-12 Network advertising revenue.</p>

    <id>http://stedy.github.io/blog/2017/10/07/states-with-multiple-football-teams-in-the-ap-top-25</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400935292">WSU beating
Oregon</a> and
<a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400935293">UW beating UC
Berkeley</a>,
the State of Washington is poised to have two football teams in the top
ten of NCAA Division I football rankings. Naturally this got me
thinking, how often does this happen and how many states have had this
same achievement?</p>

<p>To answer this I used the weekly results of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Poll">Associated Press
poll</a> which started in 1936 and
thanks to our good friends at <a href="https://donate.wikimedia.org">Wikipedia</a>,
I was able to get AP Poll results for every week.</p>

<p>I found that 25 states had at least one week where two teams from that
state were in the AP Poll. However, the more I thought about it the more
I realized this was slightly biased because some states might only have
one team (i.e. Wyoming) while other states might have two Division I
teams that are never both great at the same time (i.e. Montana). I
tightened down my restrictions a bit and only looked at the top 10 teams
from each AP Poll.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, of the 25 states with at least two teams in the AP top 25
Poll,
21 of those states had a week with at least two teams from that state in the AP top 10.
I made a summary table with the most recent year each state achieved
this distinction listed:</p>

<p>Then, I thought what if there were ever a week when a state had 3 teams
in the AP top 10. Sure enough, four states have achieved this:</p>

<td style="text-align:right;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_rankings">2015</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
