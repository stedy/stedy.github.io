    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_season">Tampa Bay
Buccaneers</a>
are set to play in (and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LV">host</a>!) the Super Bowl
becoming the third team from the City of Tampa to go to a championship
game within a year. Tampa does not currently have an NBA team so they
cannot be represented in the all four championship games of the major
professional sports leagues. However Miami does have an NBA team and
also played in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Miami_Heat_season">2020 NBA
finals</a>
so pretty good year for pro sports in the State of Florida. Naturally,
this did make me wonder if any state has ever had a team in all four
championship games in a calendar year. In 1980 Pennysylvania
accomplished exactly this:</p>

<p>| League | Team | Outcome |
| &mdash;&mdash; | &mdash;- | &mdash;&mdash;- |
| NFL | Pittsburgh Steelers | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XIV">Defeated LA Rams
31-19</a> |
| MLB | Philadelphia Phillies | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_World_Series">Defeated KC Royals
4-2</a> |
| NBA | Philadelphia 76ers | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_NBA_Finals">Lost to LA Lakers
4-2</a> |
| NHL | Philadelphia Flyers | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Stanley_Cup_Finals">Lost to New York Islanders
4-2</a> |</p>

<p>1980 Must have been a great year to live in the Keystone State!</p>

<p>Obviously not every state has a team in all four of the major sports
leagues but when was each state last in a championship game? Here is a
short table of the longest state championship game droughts greater than
ten years:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Year </th>

<tbody>

<p>I wrote all my analysis code and put it in a repo
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/blog-supplemental">here</a>. Finally all of this
talk of 1980s sports made me think of one of the greatest music videos
ever:</p>
