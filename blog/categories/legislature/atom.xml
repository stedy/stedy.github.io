    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my second post looking at the data from the 2017-18 Washington
State Legislative Session. the first part of this blog can be
read

<p>After some time looking at different bills that did pass, I started to
wonder if a bill
was more likely to pass if it had more sponsors. First I took the 647
bills passed by the Legislation and signed into law by Governor and
looked up how many co-sponsors each bill had:</p>

<p>Then I I took every bill that was introduced but did not become
law and counted up the sponsors for these:</p>

<p>So it appears that the number of sponsors is not particulary predictive
for a bill becoming law. The three bills introduced in the Senate with
the highest number of Sponsors were:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Bill </th>
<th> Sponsor count </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Summary </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5598&amp;Year=2017">5598</a> </td>
<td> 40 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Granting relatives, including but not limited to grandparents, the right to seek visitation with a child through the courts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=6037&amp;Year=2017">6037</a> </td>
<td> 28 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Concerning the uniform parentage act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5375&amp;Year=2017">5375</a> </td>
<td> 27 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Renaming the cancer research endowment authority to the Andy Hill cancer research endowment.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>And in the House:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Bill </th>
<th> Sponsor count </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Summary </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=2282&amp;Year=2017">2282</a> </td>
<td> 52 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Protecting an open internet in Washington state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1714&amp;Year=2017">1714</a> </td>
<td> 45 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Concerning nursing staffing practices at hospitals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <a href="http://apps2.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1400&amp;Year=2017">1400</a> </td>
<td> 42 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> Creating Washington state aviation special license plates.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>In November 2017, Manka Dhingra won a special election and the
Washington State Senate
flipped from Republican held to Democrat held. Initially I wanted to
focus on the number of bills passed by a Republican held Senate versus a
Democrat held Senate but there were too many extraneous variables such
as passing a budget and a shorter session in 2018. Instead, I decided to
focus on the number of Yea votes by bill</p>

<p><img src ="http://zachstednick.com/percentage_yea_votes.png"></p>

<p>Many of the bills passed were with almost overwhelming support, which is
refreshing to see that there is quite a bit of bipartisanship in
Washington State in 2018.</p>
