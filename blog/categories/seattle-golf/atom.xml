    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like many other metropolitan areas, Seattle is currently dealing with a
serious housing shortage. Recently, there have been some good articles
(<a href="https://seattletransitblog.com/2018/06/11/west-seattle-can-tunnel-housing/">here</a>
and
<a href="https://fancybeans.com/2018/01/27/what-is-a-housing-emergency-really/">here</a>)
about converting public golf
courses into housing. It is an interesting concept and certainly should
be discussed, however one aspect I feel is being overlooked in this
debate
is how popular are these golf courses anyways? According to Bloomberg
News, there is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-05-25/off-for-a-round-of-golf-this-weekend-didn-t-think-so">declining interest in golf
nationwide</a>,
is this happening in
Seattle?</p>

<p>The City of Seattle is somewhat
aware of this issue and is at least discussing
<a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/ParksAndRecreation/BriefingPapers/Golf%20Park%20Board%20Briefing%20Paper%20Final%202-6-18.pdf">options</a>
for the golf courses. I filed a <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/public-records">Public Records
Request</a> act
with the City of Seattle and they sent me data on the rounds of golf
played for
the past three years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the city only provided the count data for number of
rounds of golf played per year so I cannot look at more granular trends.
However, I can plot the counts on an annual basis.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if this debate both on converting public
golf
courses to housing goes anywhere both in Seattle and other major cities.
I don&rsquo;t have a horse in this
particular race, I live near the <a href="http://premiergc.com/-jefferson-park-golf-course">Jefferson
Park course</a> and I
really appreciate the large
expanse of green it provides however I am acutely aware of the need for
more housing within Seattle city limits.</p>

<p>Interested in taking a look? I put the full data I got from the city
