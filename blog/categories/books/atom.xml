    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year I started off the year by making Ashlee Vance&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/15743242/book/124695914">biography</a>
of Elon Musk the first book I read all year.
I wanted to start 2016 off better than 2015 and thought this book might
help my thinking. The story is on Musk is quite interesting if anything
to simply show how much he believes in himself even when the odds seem
stacked against him and the money in the bank grows lower. I tried to
use Musk&rsquo;s story to improve my own self-confidence and I felt like the most concrete way I
was able to do so was to reduce the amount I took on and instead focus
on doing a better job of what I had in front of me.</p>

<p>I will be repeating this little project in 2017 by starting the year off
by reading <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/8586497">Spread Spectrum:Hedy Lamarr and
the mobile phone</a> by Rob
Walters. I know very little about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum">spread spectrum
technology</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr">Hedy
Lamarr</a> had a very
interesting life and is greatly underappreciated in
modern society. Hopefully this book will prove to be as motivational
over the course of the year in a similar manner as Musk&rsquo;s biography was.</p>
