    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been tracking restaurant openings via the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/licenses/find-a-business">City of Seattle
Business Finder</a> since
the beginning of this year and am reporting those changes at <a href="http://seattlerestaurantchanges.com/">Seattle
Restaurant Changes</a>. Recently I
put up a <a href="http://seattlerestaurantchanges.com/heatmap.html">heatmap</a>
showing changes by neighborhood. This heatmap shows a current snaphot of
the changes which made me curious about changes by restaurant type over the course of
the year.</p>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The City of Seattle uses North American Industry Classification System
codes <a href="http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/">(NAICS)</a> to track
restaurants. I then use the date of permit issuance as a proxy for a
restaurant opening and date of permit revocation as a proxy for closing.</p></li>
<li><p>A Full Service Restaurant as defined by NAICS is &ldquo;establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to patrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress service) and pay after eating&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>I realized that not that many breweries would be opening up but who
doesn&rsquo;t want more breweries in town?</p></li>
<li><p>I was not expecting Full Service Restaurants to take off as much as
they did, especially since Limited Service Restaurants seem to be
declining.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I will try to post another update on this in December, that is unless I decide to open up a food truck of my own.</p>
