    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I bike across the Fremont Bridge twice a day which Wikipedia
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Bridge_%28Seattle%29">claims</a> is
the most frequently opened bridge in the United States.
This claim is uncited and while it may be true, due to <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=cfc62d83403b960e08f5038e67b9ecd1&amp;node=33:1.0.1.10.61.1.65.3&amp;rgn=div8">Federal Maritime
Law</a>
boats get precedence for bridge opening with the exceptions of rush
hours which in Seattle are M-F 7-9 AM and 4-6 PM. I often get to the
bridge on my bike around 9 AM in the morning and 6 PM in the evening and
it
always felt like the bridge opens for a boat right at 9 and 6 PM on the
dot. I wanted to verify this and figured the only way to do so would be
to manually time the bridge openings but that seemed like too much
effort.</p>

<p>Recently, a <a href="https://twitter.com/brotherslogsdon">friend</a> notified me about the twitter account of <a href="https://twitter.com/sdotbridges">Seattle DOT
bridges</a> which is basically a bot that
posts bridge openings and closings such as:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The
Fremont Bridge has closed to traffic - 9:43:03 AM</p>&mdash;
seattleDOTbridges (@SDOTbridges) <a
href="https://twitter.com/SDOTbridges/status/639116352200970240">September
2, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>I used the excellent <a href="https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR">twitteR</a>
to scrape tweets from Seattle DOT bridges for the past month to test how
accurate my assumption was. From this, I pulled
the first crossing post morning rush hour and evening rush hour for
weekdays only.</p>

<p>The mean opening time post-morning rush was 9:28 AM and the mean opening
time post-evening rush was 9:25 which means that my assumptions were
pretty off and I should not feel so stressed to arrive at the bridge
before 9 AM and 6 PM.</p>
