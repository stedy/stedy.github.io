    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year is the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service and I
was curious about how park attendance had changed recently. Andrew
Flowers of FiveThirtyEight had a nice
<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-national-parks-have-never-been-more-popular/">overview</a>
using official <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/National">NPS data</a>.
The article was interesting but contrary to most of FiveThirtyEight&rsquo;s
pieces there was a stunning lack of interactivity in what I felt was the
main figure of the piece</p>

<p>I remade the figure using that same data but just focusong on 2006 until
2015 and basically the popular parks stay popular and vice versa:</p>

<p>Basically, Great Smoky Mountains NP has dominated attendance since its
creation but what other parks have recently become popular? I used
<a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> to make a simple line plot that allowed for
interactively exploring park attendance based on year over year change
from the mean attendance over the last ten years:</p>

<p>Clearly a spike in recent years - maybe due to lower gas prices or
increased popularity of social media?</p>

<p>Also, I was curious about what the trend looked like for the National
Monuments.</p>

<p>The most immediate trend that jumps out is the effect of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty#Closures_and_reopening_.282001.E2.80.93present.29">closing</a> of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm">Statue of Liberty</a> in 2011 which indirectly caused a slowdown in visits to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/cacl/index.htm">Castle Clinton</a>.</p>

<p>I aim to visit some new parks and monuments this summer and hopefully
looking at the data like this will help me avoid the crowds.</p>
