    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/calendar.aspx">2018 Washington State
Primary</a> was held on
August 7, 2018. As a
registered voter in Washington State I am mailed a <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/research/2018-voters-pamphlet.aspx">Voter&rsquo;s Information
Pamphlet</a>
which lists the candidates and a Candidate
Statement (provided by the candidate) for each office. The Candidate
Statement is where the candidate is allowed to write anything they want
as long as its under 300 words. I was curious if there was any
relationship between the sentiment of a candidate&rsquo;s Statement and the
number of votes
that candidate received.</p>

<p>I conducted my analysis using sentiment analysis which groups words
together based on
pre-defined lists of words that are members of that group. There are
many word groups to choose from such as &ldquo;joy&rdquo; and &ldquo;trust&rdquo; but for this
analysis I just looked at &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;negative&rdquo; words (as classified
by <a href="http://www.saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">NRC</a>).</p>

<p>Although there were many different offices up for election in this Primary,
the U.S. Senate race had 29 candidates which made for a very rich
dataset. Washington State uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary">Top-Two
Primary</a>
which allows for easy comparison across political parties.</p>

<p>There are many factors deliberately ignored by this analysis such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index">PVI</a>,
incumbency, fundraising, political party and candidate issues. However I thought
text mining could
be an interesting way to analyze these candidates in a slightly
different manner.</p>

<p>First I just plotted the number of positive words in the Candidate
Statement for each candidate:</p>

<p>Then I repeated with the number of negative words in the Candidate
Statement for each candidate:</p>

<p>Next I looked at the number of positive words in the Candidate Statement
by candidate versus the number of votes that candidate received. Because
of the strength of the Democratic incumbent candidate <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Maria_Cantwell">Maria
Cantwell</a> and the Republican
establishment candidate <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Susan_Hutchison">Susan
Hutchison</a> I had to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">log-transform</a> the vote counts because these two candidates got so much of
the total vote.</p>

<p>Then I repeated this analysis by looking at the negative word count for
each candidate versus the total log-transformed vote count:</p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t think this will lead to any novel political insights, I
do think its an interesting way to look at candidates. Full code
