<p>I have been trying to improve my GIS skills lately and have been trying
to use R for as much of this process as I can. One of the tasks I
frequently perform is taking a shapefile, subsetting it, and then
converting to a GeoJSON. The npm module
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ogr2ogr">ogr2ogr</a> is excellent for
converting from a shapefile to GeoJSON, however I frequntly find myself
needing to select only certain areas of a shapefile. I have been using
two libraries in R to achieve this, specifically
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html">rgdal</a> and
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/">sp</a>.</p>

<p>For example, lets use the Congressional District 2012 shapefiles from
the <a href="http://www.ofm.wa.gov/pop/geographic/tiger.asp">Washington State Office of Financial
Management</a>. Downloading
the file, unzipping, and then loading into R with</p>

<p>  R> wa.cd <- readOGR("cd2012.shp", layer="cd2012")
  OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile
  Source: "cd2012.shp", layer: "cd2012"
  with 10 features
  It has 34 fields
  R> class(wa.cd)
  [1] &ldquo;SpatialPolygonsDataFrame&rdquo;
  attr(,&ldquo;package&rdquo;)
  [1] &ldquo;sp&rdquo;</p>

<p>We want to select only the districts that cover Seattle, 7 and 9 which
is as simple as subsetting</p>

<p><code>seattle.only &lt;- subset(wa.cd, CD113FP %in% c('07', '09'))</code></p>

<p>One of the nice features about GitHub gists is that you can overlay a
GeoJSON file on a Google map for a quick QC check. While R accepts a
variety of
projection formats, Github does not and I occasionally I find I have to
convert to the WGS84 datum which are easily done with</p>

<p><code>seattle.only.wgs &lt;- spTransform(seattle.only, CRS("+proj=longlat
+ellps=WGS84"))</code></p>

<p>And written out as a GeoJSON file with</p>

<p><code>writeOGR(seattle.only.wgs, dsn="seattle.only.wgs.geojson",
        layer="cd2012", driver="GeoJSON", check_exists = FALSE)</code></p>

<p>Occasionally I get an error about the file I am about to create not
being found. This Stack Overflow
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/29743969/163809">answer</a> was very helpful
and now I add the <code>check_exists = FALSE</code> parameter every time I write
out with <code>writeOGR()</code>.</p>
