that I could be displaying on a user

amazed I am by the <a href="http://feltron.com/ar12_01.html">Feltron

envious of people with abilities to easily track daily events. Instead
of getting a smartphone, I opted for a much more low
tech solution.</p>

<p>This is a picture of any bars, restaurants or events I
went to in the month of January. I am also
trying to record how often I work out and what kind of workout I am
doing. Its been interesting thus far to try and observe trends and
determine if I can gain any insight. I can definitely see why people are
interested in using a device like a fitbit and or a smartphone for
tracking. Until that day, I think I will
just stick to using pen on a calendar.</p>

			Thoughts on Solving My First 100 Problems on Project Euler</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Finally!</p>

<p><img src="http://projecteuler.net/profile/zachs.png"></p>

<p>A few years ago I set a goal to solve 100 problems on <a href="http://www.projecteuler.net">Project
Euler</a> with python. My motivation was to learn as much
about problem solving as I could and ultimately finish with <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=96">Problem
96</a>, a sudoku solver. My plan was to
write about my progess in a <a href="http://zerotosudoku.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.
More than three years later, I finally finished that goal (although I
quickly abandoned that blog after starting it). The problems definitely got harder
and it took me a while to get motivated to work on them as well as to
solve them.  I did however come up with three major lessons learned in
my first 100 problems:</p>

<p>1 - <strong>Narrow the search space</strong>
By far the biggest lesson I learned was how to cut down on possible
options before even starting to program. Since one of the rules of
Project Euler is to solve each problem within a minute, brute force
quickly gets thrown out the window. An example would be taking the
square root of the upper bound to reduce the amount of searching of
numbers above the square root. I learned to think more in depth about
the problem and try to optimize the search window to be more effiecient.</p>

<p>2 - <strong>Have a toolbox and use it</strong>
I quickly developed a set of functions that I imported frequently that
included functions such as a prime number sieve, a function to check if
a number was pandigital, and a function for getting all factors of a
number. I found that the way the problems were structured meant that I
was frequently coming back to issues or approaches I used on earlier
problems and I did not want to have to rewrite functions i had
previously used.</p>

<p>3 - <strong>Google and Stack Overflow are your friends</strong>
I used both frequently, there are many other people who post their
answers or even just the
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/projecteuler-solutions/">solutions</a>. You can
use these if you want, but I found I was able to learn about libraries such as
itertools, differences between python&rsquo;s <code>range()</code> vs. <code>xrange()</code> and
many different types of search algorithms.</p>

<p>I would highly encourage you to try out a few problems on <a href="https://www.projecteuler.net">Project
Euler</a>, I had fun and learned way more
python than I thought I would (even if it took me a few years longer than
originally planned.)</p>

			Hard Rules</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have been thinking a lot about this <a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/hard-rules">blog
post</a> and in many ways I have
to agree what the author is saying.  The internet can be a distracting
<a href="http://www.ashersarlin.com/archives/2004/09/honestly_who_co.php">place</a>
and making rules for yourself can help you stay focused and help
maintain your energy levels.  Here are some of mine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check Sports Illustrated only twice a day - around 10:30 AM and 2:30 PM</li>
<li>No reddit at work</li>
<li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.org">Hacker News</a> once a day in the evening</li>
<li>LinkedIn at most once a week</li>
<li>Check and respond to personal email only from noon - 1 PM while at
work</li>
<li>No computer after 11 PM</li>
</ul>


<p>For me, each of these were challenging to implement and I had to use browser extensions such as
  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/">Leechblock</a>
or
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji">StayFocusd</a>.
Now, with these hard rules in place I don&rsquo;t have to debate whether I
should go to a certain site or feel guilty while on that site.  Instead,
I can put that energy either into work or simply getting off the
computer faster - both of which are well worth the initial challenges of
hard rules.</p>

			Analysis of the Listserve Emails</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.thelistserve.com">The Listserve</a> is an email lottery, you sign up and once a day someone
gets a chance to send the entire list an email.  My previous
<a href="http://zachstednick.name/blog/2013/04/14/text-mining-the-listserve-emails/">post</a>
covered how I fetched these emails, this post will discuss the actual
statistics obtained from The Listserve emails.</p>

<h1>To:</h1>

<p>The Listserve website mentions the countries of subscribers but thats
about it.  As of today, there are currently 21,402 subscribers.  I
fetched all the archival data I could from Internet Archive and looked
at enrollment over time which has stayed consistent around 20,000.  I
also plotted
enrollment over <a href="http://zachstednick.com/enrollment.html">time</a>.</p>

<h1>From:</h1>

<p>The Listserve allows you to use any name you want as the sender of the email, here are the ones that occurred more than once:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Name </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Occurrence </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Anonymous </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 12</td>

<tr>

<td style="text-align:right;"> 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> T. </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Interesting that Michelle Huang had two entries, what happens if we look at first name only?</p>

<table>
<thead>

<tbody>

<td style="text-align:right;"> 3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>What about time of day sent?</p>

<p>I took all the timestamps from the emails and plotted when they were
sent based on GMT.  This was more due to personal curiosity but
interesting nonetheless.  The red line in the plot is the mean time
which ended up being 17:19:15 GMT.  Those large drops are likely due to
some nuances in email dates.  For example, I got two emails on 23 June
2012 and none on 22 June.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/arrivaltimes.png"></p>

<h1>Subject:</h1>

<p>I took all the subject lines and created a word frequency table on how
often that word occurred:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Word </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Occurrence </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> life </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> world </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> day </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> little </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> love </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> story </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> advice </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> time </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h1>Body:</h1>

<p>For the body of the email I created a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix">Term-Document Matrix</a> which is a matrix that describes the frequency of words and how often they occur together.  This allows themes and trends of the body of work or corpus, which in this case happens to be The Listserve emails.  I took all the emails and removed punctuation and stop words such as &ldquo;and&rdquo; or &ldquo;but&rdquo; and made a matrix based on how often the most common words occured together.  I then created a dendrogram of all the words and how they clustered with each other.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/dendrogram.png"></p>

<p>The majority of the words are pretty evenly clustered and its difficult
to determine any trends.  However there is a cluster on the far left
side of the tree which I zoomed in on:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/zoomin.png"></p>

<p>This cluster includes word pairs such as &ldquo;email&rdquo; and &ldquo;listserve&rdquo;, &ldquo;love&rdquo; and &ldquo;time&rdquo;, and &ldquo;life&rdquo; and &ldquo;people&rdquo;.  While its not surprising to see these words occurring so often together, it is interesting to see that a majority of people use this email to dispense wisdom or advice to the masses.</p>

<p>I have not yet been selected for The Listserve but I am sure these
findings here will strongly influence what I write.  In the meantime,
I want to learn more about text processing since I found it pretty interesting.</p>

			Text Mining the Listserve Emails</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.thelistserve.com">The Listserve</a> is an email list where
people sign up for a chance to send an email out to the entire list to
discuss whatever they want.  Currently the number of people enrolled is
about 20,000 and there has been one email per day since 16 April 2012.
I thought that since this project has been running for about a year, it
would be a nice opportunity to learn a little more about text mining.</p>

<p>In this first part I will discuss how I fetched all those emails and
parsed them and in a second blog post I will talk about what I found.</p>

<p>The first issue was how to get the emails off the server and after
trying a few solutions I finally ended up using the Python
<a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/imaplib.html">imaplib</a> which is a
Python library for connecting with an IMAP4 email server which is used
by all the major providers such as Yahoo and Google.  After connecting I
used the Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/email.html">email</a> library which helped facilitate selecting certain parts of the email.  I relied
heavily on the function <code>email.message_from_string()</code> to fetch email
attributes such as Message-ID or Sender.  I took all these emails and
dumped them into a SQLite database to later parse with
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org">R</a>.</p>

<p>I use R almost daily for work so it was nice to tackle this part of the
project with tools I knew pretty well.  I used <code>sapply()</code> and
<code>strsplit()</code> mostly to parse out parts of various email attributes and
then used the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html">tm</a>
package to handle all of the text processing.  The tm package makes it
easier to get all the emails into a term document matrix which is much
easier to work with a large corpus of text such as this.  I used an
English dictonary with the tm package to remove stop words and for
stemming (reducing the word to its base form).  There have been two
emails so far in Portuguese but the rest are all in English.</p>

<p>Initially I thought I could track all the emails by date but this proved
to be a difficult task due to the nuances of email and when they
actually got sent off the server.  Instead I ended up using the
Message-ID for making sure that I did not duplicate emails in the
analysis.</p>

<p>I put up all the source code on a github
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/thelistserve-stats">repo</a>.</p>

			Red E and Me</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sometime around the 30th of December 2012, I noticed a huge spike in
traffic on my server.  I looked at the server logs and noticed that many
of the requests were coming from <a href="http://theredecafe.com">The Red e
cafe</a>, a cafe in Portland.  I had never been
to this cafe so I looked up their website only to find my own
<a href="http://www.zachstednick.com">website</a>
staring back at me.</p>

<p>For approximately two days my index page and the associated CSS were
replacing the main site of this cafe.  It was truly bizzare and am not
sure why someone would hack a commercial site and put another site such
as an individual website in
its place.  For the lulz I guess.</p>

<p>Still, the weirdest part of this to me was that not a single person
conteacted me on twitter or any other medium to ask what I was doing on
the mainpage of their cafe.  Someday I will have to visit Red e cafe to
ask in person if this happens often to them.</p>

<p>One other interesting thing I noticed was how often my site gets hit by
a Baidu spider.  Prior to this one came by maybe once a week now one
visits about every 20 minutes.</p>

			Frugal Mondays</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My 2012 resolution was to attempt to avoid spending any money on
Mondays. <strong>tldr:</strong> I came nowhere close to that goal but it was
interesting.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>In 2010, I was slightly annoyed by Amazon deciding to stop hosting
WikiLeaks
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/03/us-wikileaks-amazon-idUSTRE6B05EK20101203">website</a>
so I made it a challenge to avoid buying anything off Amazon in 2011.
It was difficult especially for all those little things such as odd
batteries or MP3 albums from obscure music groups.  This year I decided
to step up the challenge, instead of trying to avoid spending any money
on Amazon - I would try to avoid spending any money at all on Mondays.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>My only rule was no spending physical money in the form of cash or card
and no spending money online.  I allowed Monday holidays and Mondays I was on a
work trip or vacation day to be exempted.  The hours were from 12 am
Monday morning until midnight Monday night.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>I would estimate that I was successful in about &frac34; weeks per month on
average and probably 40 Mondays for the entire year.</p>

<p>The two biggest things I noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This did not really affect my spending on larger items.  I noticed
that if it was something that I wanted that was more substantial than
just coffee I would have no qualms waiting a day to purchase it.  Most
of the purchases I did not make were for things I could spend less on
such as trips to the coffee shop.</p></li>
<li><p>I felt more focused on Mondays.  With no option to take a break and
walk to the coffee shop or wonder about where to eat lunch, I was able to keep my
head down and get some good work done.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Looking ahead, I will continue to avoid spending money on Mondays
because I find it to be an interesting challenge and anything that can
help me stay focused is highly welcome in my life.</p>
