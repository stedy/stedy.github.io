			Has the Pac-12 Network Decreased UW Home Football Game Attendance?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The University of Washington Husky football team is taking on Rutgers
this Saturday with kickoff at 11 AM PST. This is awfully early to start a game, especially a game that occurs during Labor Day weekend. The game is being aired on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Network">Pac-12 Network</a> which is about to enter its fifth year of operation. This made me wonder, with the presence of the Pac-12 Network, has attendance decreased at home UW football games?</p>

<p>Fortunately, Wikipedia lists game attendance which allows for a quick
overview of UW home games stratified by network:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/UW_football_attendance_by_TV.png"></p>

<p>The purple dots are UW home games shown on the Pac-12 network, not
entirely convincing but at first glance they don&rsquo;t look too great for
the network. I then looked at only home Pac-10/Pac-12 games and looked at attendance
by season:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/UW_football_total_attendance.png"></p>

<p>That high point in this figure is UW versus Oregon in 2013 while that particularly low point in 2015 was versus Arizona on Halloween
which happened to fall on a Thursday in 2015. Why some executive at FS1 thought it would be a good idea to schedule a game then is beyond me.</p>

<p>In 2012, UW played its home games at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CenturyLink_Field">CenturyLink
Field</a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husky_Stadium">Husky
Stadium</a> was renovated. For the 2013 season the UW football team returned to play at a smaller Husky
Stadium, did either of these factors impact attendance?</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/UW_football_percentage_capacity.png"></p>

<p>Not really, there is a minimal difference in stadium size which is
reflected in this identical-looking figure.</p>

<p>What Pac-12 opponents were the biggest draws on average?</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Opponent </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Average Attendance </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>          Oregon </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 69584</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Washington State </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 68862</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>        Colorado </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 64373</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>             USC </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 64046</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>    Oregon State </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 63777</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>        Stanford </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 63360</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>            UCLA </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 62544</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>      California </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 62541</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>         Arizona </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 60756</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Obviously there are a lot of factors that can&rsquo;t be captured by game
attendance alone but with a significant budget deficit largely blamed on
<a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-huskies/uw-athletic-department-projects-budget-deficit-of-14-million-for-2016-fiscal-year/">reduced
attendance</a>, it seems like it might be time for the UW to analyze if the Pac-12 Network has really been worth the investments to date.</p>

			This American Life Stats</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Lately I have been listening to episodes of <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American
Life</a> faster than they are making them
which means I have been going back to the archive for past unheard shows. Their website has a nice <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/user/login">user section</a> where you can log in and mark episodes you have heard and your favorites. The archives are arranged by year which naturally got me thinking about the number episodes I have listened to by year. A search of GitHub revealed many libraries for downloading episodes of the podcast but none that were interested in user statistics so I decided to write my own library. I am still very much beginner level with technologies such as passing cookies and CSRF requests which is why I ultimately ended up using <a href="https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Splinter</a> which just lets you automate browser actions. I used that to login and navigate the TAL archives by year. I then used <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> to parse the HTML. Finally, I just wanted to visualize the results so I used Mike Bostock&rsquo;s <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304">D3 Bar Chart example</a>.</p>

			Slopeplots of African GDP With Ggplot2</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I finally got around to reading <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/13493349">Poor
Numbers</a> by <a href="http://mortenjerven.com/">Morton
Jerven</a> and found it really interesting. Basically Jerven argues that
academic literature has either &ldquo;neglected the issue of data quality and
therefore accepted the data at face value or dismissed the data as
unreliable and therefore irrelevant&rdquo; and this causes many issues with
the more data-driven approach to international aid in recent years.</p>

<p>The key table in this book was (in my opinion) a largely inscrutable table that showed
African economies ranked by per capita GDP with data from three
different sources of national income data: the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development
Indicators</a>,
<a href="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm">Angus
Maddison</a>, and
<a href="http://www.rug.nl/research/ggdc/data/pwt/">Penn World Tables</a>. The
differences in the rankings is hard to parse in a table but  would
theoretically lend
themselves well to a slopegraph originally proposed by Edward Tufte in
<a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/7983">The Visual Display of Quantitative
Information</a></p>

<p><img src="http://charliepark.org/images/slopegraphs/slopegraph.gif"></p>

<p>Although not a true slopeplot, I was able to use a combination of
<code>geom_line</code> from ggplot2 and the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/directlabels/">directlabels
package</a> to
generate the following plot (which I will admit is a bit of a hack):</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/AfricanEconomiesbyGDP.png"></p>

<p>I was mainly interested in observing the variation in the top ten or so
countries which this plot handles well. The remaining 35 or so countries
are difficult to tell apart mostly due to very large differences in GDP.
A log transformed plot shows that
there is generally more consistency within the different rating agencies
but some variation between them.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/AfricanEconomiesbyGDP_logscaled.png"></p>

<p>Slopegraphs are an effective and efficient way to visualize this type of data which
is odd because I feel like they are rarely used and only barely
mentioned in Tufte&rsquo;s works. Hopefully more people being exposed to them
will result in further usage.</p>

			Changes in NPS Visits Over Time With D3</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This year is the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service and I
was curious about how park attendance had changed recently. Andrew
Flowers of FiveThirtyEight had a nice
<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-national-parks-have-never-been-more-popular/">overview</a>
using official <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/National">NPS data</a>.
The article was interesting but contrary to most of FiveThirtyEight&rsquo;s
pieces there was a stunning lack of interactivity in what I felt was the
main figure of the piece</p>

<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/flowers-national-parks-4.png?quality=90&strip=all&w=575&ssl=1"></p>

<p>I remade the figure using that same data but just focusong on 2006 until
2015 and basically the popular parks stay popular and vice versa:</p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/rankNP.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="height:500px; width:1060px;" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>Basically, Great Smoky Mountains NP has dominated attendance since its
creation but what other parks have recently become popular? I used
<a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> to make a simple line plot that allowed for
interactively exploring park attendance based on year over year change
from the mean attendance over the last ten years:</p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/deltaNP.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="height:500px; width:1060px;" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>Clearly a spike in recent years - maybe due to lower gas prices or
increased popularity of social media?</p>

<p>Also, I was curious about what the trend looked like for the National
Monuments.</p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/deltaNM.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="height:500px; width:1060px;" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>The most immediate trend that jumps out is the effect of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty#Closures_and_reopening_.282001.E2.80.93present.29">closing</a> of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm">Statue of Liberty</a> in 2011 which indirectly caused a slowdown in visits to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/cacl/index.htm">Castle Clinton</a>.</p>

<p>I aim to visit some new parks and monuments this summer and hopefully
looking at the data like this will help me avoid the crowds.</p>

			A National Parks Tour With Feather</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This year is the 100th Anniversary of the National Park system and the
National Park Service is kicking things off with <a href="https://www.nps.gov/findapark/national-park-week.htm">National Park
Week</a> where every
National Park will be open for free. With all the savings, my next
thought was what would be the best way to visit all of them in a single
trip?</p>

<p>To calculate this, I used a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde_TSP_Solver">Concorde
algorithm</a> which is
an algorithm for solving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem">Traveling Salesman
Problem</a> or
what is the shortest route I can use to visit every National Park?</p>

<p>This also gave me an excellent opportunity to use
<a href="https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/03/29/feather/">Feather</a> a way of writing
dataframes to disk for interchanging between R and Python. I wanted to
use R largely due to Michael Hahsler&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/mhahsler/TSP">TSP
library</a> and I wanted to use python
because of the ease of use of the Google Maps API client. Finally, I
wanted to make a static map to show the route and I decided return to R
and use the <a href="https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap">ggmap library</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/NP_tour.png"></p>

<p>I realize there are many ways to call R from Python and vice versa but I
wanted to try feather. As a first attempt, I was
pretty impressed with feather&rsquo;s ease of use. I did not have too large of
a dataset so I was unable to comment on the speed but simple reading and
writing in R and Python is made to feel very simple. The one issue I did run into was
more of a user issue and that it was challenging to rapidly flip back and forth
between the two languages as I iterated this code. The 0-index of Python versus
the 1-index of R is all handled by feather which is nice not to have to think
about.</p>

<p>As a whole, I highly recommend checking out feather and as for me, well
its time to hit the road and start visiting some National Parks and
according to Google Maps I only have 14832.8 miles to go.</p>

<p>My code for this lives
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/blog-supplemental">here</a></p>

Similar to last time, I made a few assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>A keg is on tap until it is empty.</li>
<li>Each keg only serves pints of beer.</li>
<li>A pint is the only unit served (ie no 8 oz. pours).</li>

			Thoughts on Pronto</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.prontocycleshare.com/">Pronto bikeshare</a> is in serious
financial trouble and may not make it
until the end of <a href="http://www.seattlebikeblog.com/2016/02/04/pronto-needs-city-buyout-before-end-of-march-how-did-we-get-here/">March of this
year</a>.
There has been a lot of talk about the future of Pronto and funding but for now I
just wanted to mention a few of the things I like
about Pronto.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is an excellent great for connecting mass transit and your final destination.
Waiting for a bus transfer and then taking said transfer sometimes
feels like it takes forever and
hopping on a Pronto bike can make the trip dramatically faster.</p></li>
<li><p>It provides an ideal solution for just going somewhere and not worrying about your bike.
Worried about locking up your bike in a certain area at a certain
time? If there is a Pronto station nearby that problem can be easily
fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>It is fun, full stop. The bikes are very sturdy and while they can feel
a bit slow I never feel like they will have physical problems or break
down. Yeah, I
realize I look like a dork while riding it but then again I run
my own blog, who am I to judge?</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, cars treat you as if you have never been on a bike before and
give you significant leeway. On my commuter bike I often get buzzed by
cars but on a Pronto I get treated like some tourist who has no
clue what they are doing. From a safety standopint, thats pretty tough
to beat.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I think that Pronto had a terrible rollout (starting a bikeshare program
in October?) and as multiple people have
shown, it does not have the best station placement compared to a
similarly sized metropolitan area.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en"
dir="ltr">Seattle&#39;s <a
href="https://twitter.com/CyclePronto">@CyclePronto</a> and DC&#39;s <a

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>


<p> I have had multiple
problems with bike docks and the helmet locker can sometimes be unresponsive. But, even after all that, I
am long on Pronto and am constantly telling people about it. I had an
<a href="http://prontostories.com">entry</a> in the <a href="http://www.prontocycleshare.com/datachallenge">Pronto Data
Challenge</a>. I was even
planning on doing both the <a href="http://www.cascade.org/rides-major-rides/emerald-city-bike-ride">Emerald
City Bike
Ride</a>
and
<a href="http://obliteride.org/">Obliteride</a> on a Pronto bike just because I
thought it would be fun.</p>

<p>Seattle is growing,
really fast in fact, and giving people as many transit options as
possible will only make it that much easier for people to move around. I
really hope that Pronto lasts longer than the end of March and is
eventually able
to expand to cover more areas. As to whether the city should step in to
save it or not, we&rsquo;ll leave that
exercise to the reader.</p>

			Weekend at Chuck&#8217;s</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://chucks85th.com">Chuck&rsquo;s Hop Shop on 85th</a> is a beer store with
40 beers on tap and hundreds if not thousands of bottled beers for sale.
I have always been curious about what types of beers they go though
fastest and what are some of the more popular breweries.
Fortunately, they post their current tap list on their website which
allowed me to look at their data over the course of the weekend.</p>

<p>I scraped their website every 15 minutes from opening Friday,
January 29 - closing Sunday, January 30th. Their website also lists cost
per pint,
cost per growler, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABV">ABV</a>.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this analysis, I made a few assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>A keg is on tap until it is empty.</li>
<li>Each keg only serves pints of beer.</li>
<li>A pint is the only unit served (ie no 8 oz. pours).</li>
</ul>


<p>With these assumptions in mind, my first question was which beer goes
fastest? The below table shows beers that were on tap for five hours or
less:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Brewery         </th>
<th>Beer                 </th>
<th style="text-align:right;">    Minutes on tap </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Bale Breaker    </td>
<td> Field 41 Pale        </td>
<td style="text-align:right;">  74.98333</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Boneyard        </td>
<td> Hop Venom IIPA       </td>
<td style="text-align:right;">  74.98333</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Almanac         </td>
<td> Elephant Heart de&hellip; </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 134.98333</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Firestone       </td>
<td> Wookey Jack CDA      </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 224.98333</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> pFriem          </td>
<td> Imperial IPA         </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 240.00833</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Sound           </td>
<td> Dubbel Entendre      </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 270.00000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Bale Breaker    </td>
<td> Top Cutter IPA       </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 277.48333</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Kulshan         </td>
<td> Bastard Kat IPA      </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 284.98333</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Roslyn          </td>
<td> Brookside Pale Lager </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 284.98333</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Breakside       </td>
<td> Vienna Coffee OG &hellip; </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 299.86667</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Bale Breaker    </td>
<td> High Camp Winter &hellip; </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 300.00833</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>In a first place tie for a duration of a stunning <em>1 hour fifteen</em> minutes were
Bale Breaker Field 41 Pale and Hop Venom IIPA. There may be
another explanation but with respective BeerAdvocate scores of
<a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/31389/93176/?ba=beertunes">89</a>
and <a href="http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23066/72750/">97</a>, its
easy to see why they are so popular.</p>

<h1>Price of a pint vs. ABV</h1>

<p>Is there a correlation between the price of a pint of beer and the ABV?</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/cost_vs_abv.png"></p>

<h1>Drinking based on ABV</h1>

<p>Do beers with higher ABV get ordered faster?</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/min_on_tap_vs_abv.png"></p>

<h1>Are beers at Chuck&rsquo;s veblen goods?</h1>

<p>Do pricier beer move faster?</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/min_on_tap_vs_price.png"></p>

<p>Obviously there are many more types of analysis one could look at with
this data. I do think this analysis was sorely lacking in first person
research, something I intend to fix in the next analysis. Full code on

			2016 Africa Reading Challenge</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A blog I occasionally read issues a challenge every year that is simply to read <a href="http://kinnareads.com/2016/01/06/2016-africa-reading-challenge/">five books from Africa</a>. Since it has been ten years since I moved from Africa back to the States, I figured this would be a good time to finally take on this challenge. I will likely be writing up shor reviews of these on my LibraryThing <a href="https://www.librarything.com/profile/pbirch01">page</a>. My current list includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tram 83 by Fiston Mwanza Mujila (<a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/15037664">LT page</a>)</li>
<li>The Fishermen by Chigozie Obioma (<a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/15400542">LT page</a>)</li>
<li>Waiting for the Barbarians by J.M. Coetzee (Really liked everything I
have read by him, not sure why I have never read this one. <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/3619">LT
page</a>)</li>
<li>Wizard of the Crow by Ngugi wa&#8217;Thiong&#8217;o (Second book set in a
fictional country, perhaps a subtheme for the year? <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/1026301">LT
page</a>)</li>
<li>The Second Coming of Mavala Shikongo by Peter Orner (Okay, not an
African writer but it is set where I used to live so I think well
worth bending the rules a bit for. <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/853774">LT page</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Looking forward to this challenge and you should join in if you feel so
inclined.</p>

			Summarizing the Seattle Restaurant Scene in 2015</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Seattle is experiencing sustained economic growth which manifests
itself in a variety of ways, one of the most visible being changes in
the restaurant
industry. However, tracking the exact changes can be difficult due
to a variety of factors such the size of the city and the difficulty in
aggregating reliable data. There are several options for attempting to
track changes such as scraping data from a review site such as Yelp or
Zomato, systematically
checking the Food section of the local paper, or going straight to the city
records and attempt to
determine what restaurant permits are being issued over time.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this analysis, I decided to compare official city permit
records with the Food column from a local paper, specifically <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/">The
Stranger</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I started scraping the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/licenses/find-a-business">City of Seattle Business
License
database</a> which
tracks both permit issuance and revocations. The City of Seattle site
classifies permits based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Industry_Classification_System">NAICS
codes</a>.
Because I am only interested in restaurant related permits, I focused on
the following five NAICS codes: Breweries, Drinking Places
(Alcoholic Beverages), Mobile Food Services, Limited-Service
Restaurants, and Full-Service Restaurants. I tracked changes in permits
by
week which when looked at for the entire year produces the following
figure:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/City_DB_NAICS_2015.png"></p>

<p>Clearly a good time to be in the food truck business. Also I am not sure
why so many Limited-Service Restaurants are closing and so many
Full-Service
Restaurants are opening. It could be simply that the restaurant decided
to expand its service or attempt to cater to a different clientele.
According to the official
<a href="http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?code=722511&amp;search=2012">definition</a>,
the NAICS code for Full-Service Restaurant
is that &ldquo;Providing food services to patrons who order and are served
while seated and pay after eating&rdquo;. For more details
on these changes, I have made an <a href="http://seattlerestaurantchanges.com">interactive
site</a> that allows you to further
investigate by neighborhood and restaurant type.</p>

<p>For comparison, I looked at every column I could
find by <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/authors/31833/angela-garbes">Angela
Garbes</a> who
seems to be the main restaurant reporter at The Stranger. I looked at
every restaurant opening and closing she mentioned in her
column. I then
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HFS4H8E-4RiM47pQzbauLzjfKSoEzv3IZ6Xl2PbHmIg/edit?usp=sharing">classified</a>
all the restaurants she mentioned
based on the same NAICS code to generate a similar figure:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Stranger_NAICS_2015.png"></p>

<p>Obviously, she has a lot less data and her column is focused on more of
the narrative of big name restaurants that
have opened and less likely to focus on something like a new Taco Time.
She focuses a lot on local food events such as popup restaurants as well
as restaurant personnel which is not something that shows up in the
official city
statistics. Regardless, our figures look very similar and both of the
datasets
show that Full-Service Restaurants have had sustained growth over the
entire year, which makes for great storytelling either with data or a
narrative and
benefits all of us with increased diversity of restaurant options.</p>
