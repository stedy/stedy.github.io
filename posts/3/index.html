			Subsetting Shapefiles With R</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have been trying to improve my GIS skills lately and have been trying
to use R for as much of this process as I can. One of the tasks I
frequently perform is taking a shapefile, subsetting it, and then
converting to a GeoJSON. The npm module
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ogr2ogr">ogr2ogr</a> is excellent for
converting from a shapefile to GeoJSON, however I frequntly find myself
needing to select only certain areas of a shapefile. I have been using
two libraries in R to achieve this, specifically
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html">rgdal</a> and
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/">sp</a>.</p>

<p>For example, lets use the Congressional District 2012 shapefiles from
the <a href="http://www.ofm.wa.gov/pop/geographic/tiger.asp">Washington State Office of Financial
Management</a>. Downloading
the file, unzipping, and then loading into R with</p>

<p><script
src="https://gist.github.com/stedy/b05e2e11e309b66eb28e.js"></script></p>

<p>We want to select only the districts that cover Seattle, 7 and 9 which
is as simple as subsetting</p>

<p><code>seattle.only &lt;- subset(wa.cd, CD113FP %in% c('07', '09'))</code></p>

<p>One of the nice features about GitHub gists is that you can overlay a
GeoJSON file on a Google map for a quick QC check. While R accepts a
variety of
projection formats, Github does not and I occasionally I find I have to
convert to the WGS84 datum which are easily done with</p>

<p><code>seattle.only.wgs &lt;- spTransform(seattle.only, CRS("+proj=longlat
+ellps=WGS84"))</code></p>

<p>And written out as a GeoJSON file with</p>

<p><code>writeOGR(seattle.only.wgs, dsn="seattle.only.wgs.geojson", layer="cd2012", driver="GeoJSON", check_exists = FALSE)</code></p>

<p>Occasionally I get an error about the file I am about to create not
being found. This Stack Overflow
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/29743969/163809">answer</a> was very helpful
and now I add the <code>check_exists = FALSE</code> parameter every time I write
out with <code>writeOGR()</code>.</p>

			Fremont Bridge Opening Times</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I bike across the Fremont Bridge twice a day which Wikipedia
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Bridge_%28Seattle%29">claims</a> is
the most frequently opened bridge in the United States.
This claim is uncited and while it may be true, due to <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=cfc62d83403b960e08f5038e67b9ecd1&amp;node=33:1.0.1.10.61.1.65.3&amp;rgn=div8">Federal Maritime
Law</a>
boats get precedence for bridge opening with the exceptions of rush
hours which in Seattle are M-F 7-9 AM and 4-6 PM. I often get to the
bridge on my bike around 9 AM in the morning and 6 PM in the evening and
it
always felt like the bridge opens for a boat right at 9 and 6 PM on the
dot. I wanted to verify this and figured the only way to do so would be
to manually time the bridge openings but that seemed like too much
effort.</p>

<p>Recently, a <a href="https://twitter.com/brotherslogsdon">friend</a> notified me about the twitter account of <a href="https://twitter.com/sdotbridges">Seattle DOT
bridges</a> which is basically a bot that
posts bridge openings and closings such as:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The
Fremont Bridge has closed to traffic - 9:43:03 AM</p>&mdash;
seattleDOTbridges (@SDOTbridges) <a
href="https://twitter.com/SDOTbridges/status/639116352200970240">September
2, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I used the excellent <a href="https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR">twitteR</a>
to scrape tweets from Seattle DOT bridges for the past month to test how
accurate my assumption was. From this, I pulled
the first crossing post morning rush hour and evening rush hour for
weekdays only.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Fremont_bridge_openings.png"></p>

<p>The mean opening time post-morning rush was 9:28 AM and the mean opening
time post-evening rush was 9:25 which means that my assumptions were
pretty off and I should not feel so stressed to arrive at the bridge
before 9 AM and 6 PM.</p>

			Batch Collection of Park Boundaries With Open Street Map</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Open Street Map (OSM) is, simply put, a freely available and editable
map of the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">world</a>. I have been interested in
improving the availability of <a href="https://github.com/openseattle/seattle-boundaries">boundaries in Seattle</a> and wanted
to add park boundaries to this list as well. It was easy to look up
boundaries on OSM, for example <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/53600070">Salmon Bay Park</a> shows the various nodes that
make up its boundaries. But I had struggled with how to automate this
search since at last count Seattle had over <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/listall.asp">400
parks</a>. After months of
struggling with the OSM API, I fortuitously stumbed
across the following tweet:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>This tweet lead me to Mapzen which provides a service called <a href="https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/">Metro
Extracts</a> which provides
datasets from OSM on a weekly basis. I downloaded the OSM2PGSQL GeoJSON
file for Seattle which provided me files for Line, Point, and
Polygon geometries. I then used
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ogr2ogr">ogr2ogr</a> to filter for parks
only with the command</p>

<p><code>ogr2ogr select 'osm_id, name, geometry' where "leisure = 'park'"</code></p>

<p>This produced a GeoJSON file that looked like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/stedy/d11ab757400fd5375796.js"></script>


<p>Obviously, more filtering needed to be done. Since many of these parks
were not in Seattle, I used the Nominatim API to search for each park
based on the OSM ID number. For example, the above mentioned park Salmon
Bay Park returns a nicely formatted <a href="http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/lookup?osm_ids=W53600070">XML
file</a> which
I just filtered based on city.</p>

<p>Even after this there were still parks that were wrongly labelled as
being in Seattle. I loaded the file into R and subset based on OSM ID
and then used
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/">rgdal</a> to write the
final result out as a GeoJSON file.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/stedy/1ef0a40bc8c29f7412a0.js"></script>


<p>The take home lesson for me is that OSM is an excellent service but as
with any publically annotated dataset be prepared to invest some time
into cleaning and validating the data.</p>

			Update on Restaurant Changes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have been tracking restaurant openings via the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/licenses/find-a-business">City of Seattle
Business Finder</a> since
the beginning of this year and am reporting those changes at <a href="http://seattlerestaurantchanges.com/">Seattle
Restaurant Changes</a>. Recently I
put up a <a href="http://seattlerestaurantchanges.com/heatmap.html">heatmap</a>
showing changes by neighborhood. This heatmap shows a current snaphot of
the changes which made me curious about changes by restaurant type over the course of
the year.</p>

<iframe width="980" height="520" src="http://zachstednick.com/net_restaurant_changes.html"></iframe>


<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The City of Seattle uses North American Industry Classification System
codes <a href="http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/">(NAICS)</a> to track
restaurants. I then use the date of permit issuance as a proxy for a
restaurant opening and date of permit revocation as a proxy for closing.</p></li>
<li><p>A Full Service Restaurant as defined by NAICS is &ldquo;establishments primarily engaged in providing food services to patrons who order and are served while seated (i.e., waiter/waitress service) and pay after eating&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>I realized that not that many breweries would be opening up but who
doesn&rsquo;t want more breweries in town?</p></li>
<li><p>I was not expecting Full Service Restaurants to take off as much as
they did, especially since Limited Service Restaurants seem to be
declining.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I will try to post another update on this in December, that is unless I decide to open up a food truck of my own.</p>

			The Felix Factor</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I was listening to the Jonah Keri
<a href="http://espn.go.com/espnradio/grantland/player?id=12957030">podcast</a> and
he and Ben Gibbard were talking about the Mariners, specifically <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/433587/felix-hernandez/2015/career/R/pitching/MLB">Felix
Hernandez</a>.
One of the points Gibbard made was that Hernandez is so outstanding that
he will be remembered and that people should try to see him pitch in
person. This made me wonder, did Felix Hernandez have an impact on home
ticket sales for the Mariners in 2014?</p>

<p>I was able to get all the data from some of the nicely formatted box
score data that <a href="http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2014/">MLB provides</a>. I initially tried to look at the data over the course of the year but attendance was so variable (which made for an extremely confusing plot) that I just ended up making a box and whiskers plot and ignored the date element:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/felix_factor.png"></p>

<p>Conclusion: Hernandez was not that strong of a driver of ticket sales
which is great news if you are hoping to see him pitching in person.</p>

			Seattle Restaurant Changes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Seattle construction is currently booming and I was interested in how
that
reflected in the local restaurant scene. There are many food blogs and
local news sites that cover openings and closings, but I found it too
difficult to parse these in a regular manner. Fortunately I was able to
use data from the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/licenses/find-a-business">City of Seattle business
finder</a> and used the
restaurant classification or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAICS">NAICS</a> code as a proxy. Using the
data in this manner makes an assumption that a restaurant will no longer
have a business licence after it closes.
I&rsquo;m not sure how accurate this is but I figured it was as accurate as I
could get short of hiring people on Mechanical Turk to phone every
restaurant every week and ask if the restaurant is still open. To map each
restaurant to a particular neighborhood, I
used geolocation to map license address returned by the City of Seattle business
finder. Obviously that does not work as well for Mobile Food Services
(i.e. food trucks) but it still allows for an interesting comparison.
This data is plotted at <a href="http://seattlerestaurantchanges.com">Seattle Restaurant
Changes</a>.</p>

<p>I initially attempted to scrape
data from <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/food-and-drink">The Stranger</a> but
after finding the City of Seattle site I just used
<a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> for the
scraping. I would not have been able to do much more beyond that state
if it had not been for Nathan Yau&rsquo;s excellent tutorial on <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2015/02/19/make-an-interactive-map-with-category-filters/">making maps
with category
filters</a>.
I was able to get a state level shapefile for Washington state from
<a href="http://www.zillow.com/blog/7000-neighborhood-boundary-files-in-shapefile-format-4653/">Zillow</a>
and then reduce that to just Seattle neighborhoods using R&rsquo;s
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/">sp</a> package. Full code

			First Year on Fitbit</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>After a year on <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/user/2F49C2">Fitbit</a>, I figured it might be time to take a look at the data that I have been generating. Unfortunately, Fitbit makes you sign up for <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/premium/export">Premium</a> which charges you $50 per year to export your data. Fortunately, Cory Nissen has created an excellent <a href="https://github.com/corynissen/fitbitScraper">R package</a> for doing just this. The package simply uses a POST request handled by Hadley&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/hadley/httr">httr</a> library to generate a cookie and then parses the returned JSP results to return a nice <code>data.frame</code>.</p>

<p>Anyways, onto the data.</p>

<p>The first command I tried was the <code>get_15_min_data()</code> for parsing step
data in 15 minute increments. I figured that looking at yesterday&rsquo;s data
would be granular enough to get a good feel for the data.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/fifteen_min_fitbit.png"></p>

<p>I then plotted number of steps taken per day, with a smoothing function
overlaid:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/one_year_fitbit_steps.png"></p>

<p>I had a mean step count of 13935 for the past year. This data is more
interesting to look at as more of an overall trend. There definitely a
seasonal trend in the summer which makes sense. I can also see the
signatures of when I went on a four day backpacking trip in August and
when I broke two ribs and was confined to the couch for four days in
mid-March.</p>

<p>Since I have a Fitbit one, I can also measure floors climbed.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/fitbit_one_year_floors.png"></p>

<p>My mean number of floors climbed is 69.62 which seems absurdly high. My
desk is on the fourth floor of my building and I usually take the stairs
but not sure that is enough to fully explain why these counts are so
high.</p>

<p>Still, it is pretty interesting to look at this data outside of the
Fitbit interface and I would highly recommend checking out Cory&rsquo;s github
<a href="https://github.com/corynissen/fitbitScraper">repo</a></p>

<p>Also, speaking of github, for those of you who regularly follow this
blog (hi, Mom!) I have moved away from making a new gist every time to
simply having a standalone
<a href="https://github.com/stedy/blog-supplemental">repo</a></p>

			Offsetting Beer by Running</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last year, among other personal data, I tracked every bar I went to and
every mile I
<a href="http://zachstednick.name/blog/2014/02/06/foursquare-without-a-smartphone/">ran</a>.
Naturally my first question is do I run enough to offset the amount of
beer I am drinking (at bars)?</p>

<p>First we define some units. According to this Runner&rsquo;s World
<a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/tools/calories-burned-calculator">calculator</a>, at 8:45 minute/mile for my
weight I am burning 145 calories. Google says the amount of calories in
a <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=calories+in+a+pint+of+beer">pint of
beer</a> is about 180. Since I usually average about two beers each time I go to a bar, that simplifies the calculations. Over the course of the year, how often was I above or below the residual? To answer this, I used R and finally got around to trying <a href="https://github.com/hadley/tidyr">tidyr</a> which is pretty slick.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/running_vs_beers.png"></p>

<p>I thougth a lot about how to determine the residual but eventually
settled on calories out - calories in because I felt this method made the best
visualization. As you can see around week 30, I started to run more and
did a better job at offsetting my beer consumption. Obviously this is an
overly simplistic view of my caloric expenditure but shows some of the
interesting insights that can be gained from personal data.</p>

<p>As always, all code and data is in this github

			Summarizing Books Read Over Time</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I recently read an interesting blog post where the author examined their books rated on Goodreads and summarizing <a href="http://citizen-statistician.org/2014/12/31/annual-review-of-reading/">interesting
trends</a>.
I decided to do a similar analysis even though I use
<a href="https://www.librarything.com/profile/pbirch01">LibraryThing</a>
instead.</p>

<p>LibraryThing has a nice option to allow to to export your data in a
variety of <a href="https://www.librarything.com/export.php">formats</a>. Since I
write R code to parse CSV files everyday I thought I would do something
different and parse a JSON file with python.</p>

<p>I have been on LibraryThing since 2007 and the first question I was
interested in was have my average ratings changed over time? I
calculated the mean for each book by year:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Year </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Average Rating </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 2007 </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 3.446809</td>
</tr>

<p>While uninteresting, this makes a lot of sense - if I am reading a book
that I do not enjoy, I will usually bail on it which tends to bias my
ratings upward. Over time, there have been a few notable
<a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/11691727/reviews/92168929">exceptions</a>.</p>

<p>One of the other interesting analyses in the blog post was examining how the
reviewer&rsquo;s ratings have changed based on the month of the year. I wanted to
make a similar plot using R&rsquo;s
<a href="http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html">ggplot2</a> however since I
was writing this in python I was largely limited to matplotlib.
Fortunately, many people have struggled with this issue and the fine
folks at yhat have ported ggplot2 over to
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ggplot">python</a>. With this library I was
able to use <code>geom_smooth</code> to produce the following plot showing rating
trends by week.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/all_years.png"></p>

<p>I tried to figure out why my legend never showed up but I figured that
since most of the trend lines were pretty much the same anyways that the
plot was fine without a legend. It appears that I get in most of my good
reviews early in the year and am harsher later in the year.</p>

<p>The last figure in the blog post compares the writer&rsquo;s review scores to
the Goodreads consensus score. I attempted to
replicate this but ran into more trouble than it was worth to extract
that data from LibraryThing so I abandoned that analysis.</p>

<p>If interested, I put my python code in a GitHub
<a href="https://gist.github.com/stedy/2cb4fb1f332508f39ff2">gist</a>.</p>

			Simple Webstats With R</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As someone who puts out writings out publically, I am naturally curious who (if anyone) is actually reading what I write. To answer this I developed a simple webstat calculator using R. I realize there are many options out there for tracking visits but to paraphrase my friend Andy, <a href="http://wingolog.org/archives/2014/11/14/on-yakshave-on-color-on-cosines-on-glitchen">when has using standard libraries lead to anything cool?</a>.</p>

<p>My main interests in this project is to answer two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are people visting this site?</p></li>
<li><p>Where are they visting from?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I don&rsquo;t really care about things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate">bounce rate</a> or type of device used to access the site. Not having to worry about either of these issues helps cut down on the complexity. I run this site on an Apache server and use a standard log output to write my logfile:
<code>LogFormat "%v:%p %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %&gt;s %O \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"</code></p>

<p>I made a small R script that uses <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/">knitr</a> to output plots to HTML for ease in viewing. I wrote a shell script that uses the excellent <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/littler.html">little r</a> to perform the commands. I run the shell script daily as a cron job and only look back at the past week&rsquo;s worth of data. Since this blog is served on github pages, it can be difficult to see page views so I use images loaded as a proxy.</p>

<p>Here are some example plots of recent visitors:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/visitor.png"></p>

<p>And then another plot of visitor locations:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/referrer_location.png"></p>

<p>That outlier from Brazil is likely a Google bot crawling the site; better detection and removal of bot traffic from the final output is on the TODO list. All of the code (minus the shell script) lives on <a href="https://github.com/stedy/simple-webstats">github</a></p>
