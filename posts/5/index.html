			Running Flask on CentOS</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Notes on installing my flask app on CentOS</h1>

<p>I developed a small <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">flask</a> application at work and put it on a server
running CentOS which I ended up spending a few days struggling with
getting it up and running.  Hopefully this helps someone else
avoid some of the pain I had.  Jumping right in, the first thing I did
was install flask, since CentOS 6.3 comes with python 2.6.6 it was easy to
install pip-python and use that to get flask.  Since the server was
running Apache 2.2, I put my webapp in /var/www/html. Next step was to
install httpd_devel and mod_wsgi both of which easily installed from
source.  Everything seemed fine but I kept getting an HTTP 500 error
message, here is what I did:</p>

<p>There was a lot of editing of /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to allow for vitrual hosts.<br/>
This was also the first time I had worked on a subdomain but my DNS had supposedly been setup correctly.</p>

<h2>Is mod_wsgi in the right place?</h2>

<p>Check that mod_wsgi.so is in /usr/lib/httpd/modules a</p>

<p><code>-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 315812 Sep  4 10:20 mod_wsgi.so</code></p>

<p>The <code>.</code> at the end of the permissions field is the SELinux (in this case
CentOS) ACL.</p>

<h2>Does the application have SE Linux permissions?</h2>

<p><code>bash: semanage: comand not found</code></p>

<p>Since semanage is not found I am assume that we are running CentOS
without any additional security.</p>

<h2>Are we loading mod_wsgi correctly?</h2>

<p>Add a line to httpd.conf</p>

<p><code>LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so</code></p>

<h2>Is the socket file set up correctly?</h2>

<p>Socket file not able to write to directory, set socket file to write to
/tmp using WSGISocketPrefix to allow www-data worker process to connect.</p>

<h2>Server still giving HTTP 500</h2>

<p>This is where I started trying everything I could thinkof.  I set
LogLevel to debug and later set LogLevel to info and still could not
figure out what was going on. I even asked on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12416532/mod-wsgi-test-wsgi-runs-fine-application-gives-http-500">stack
overflow</a>
with little luck.</p>

<h2>Solved!</h2>

<p>Basically, I was not explicit enough in my file path names which caused the majority of these headaches.  I assumed that CentOS would be like
Debian in how it parsed filepaths, however this was wrong and this
caused more headaches than needed.  Since this was a python application,
you would think that I would recall from the Zen of Python that
&ldquo;Explicit is better than implicit&rdquo; but in this case you would be wrong.
remember the Zen of Python</p>

			Kalalau Trail</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My wife and I just did the Kalalau trail in Na Pali State park and I wanted to put out some of my general thoughts to help make it easier for someone else who may be interested.  Prior to departure I had a hard time determining what was important and what to trust based on what I read online.  Hopefully this is helpful, although your milage may vary.</p>

<p>The Hawaii State Parks office is in what might be the tallest building in
Lihue.  They will give you an informational brochure with a map and try
to sell you a topo map of the entire island.  We thoguht this would be
a good informational stop but I think best to skip stopping here and use the map in your guidebook.</p>

<p>The trail itself is difficult, but not quite as dramatic as most of the literature makes it out to be.  The first half to Hanakoa Valley is the most up and down and felt like the hardest part in both directions.  The second half feels much easier.  Hanakoa Valley is a great place to stay if you are not feeling up to doing the trek in one day.  Plus, staying here gives you a full afternoon at the beach as opposed to getting in late in the day.  There is a pretty steep and exposed part around mile 8 or 9 that I was glad to walk across when I was properly rested.</p>

<p>We brought packs and a tent and rented a stove and bought fuel at <a href="http://www.pedalnpaddle.com">Pedal
n&#8217; Paddle</a> in Hanalei which also sold us some of the other things we forget (such as a cooking pot).  There is a grocery store next door that is pretty well stocked.  You may be able to save a few bucks by planning in advance and shopping elsewhere.</p>

<p>We found the mosquitos were a nuisance, but nothing intolerable and the seemed much smaller and less vigorous than those we have on the mainland.  Bug spray was nice but not essential.</p>

<p>We left our car at Ha&#8217;ena State Park.  There is not a lot of parking at the end of the road and we saw some cars that were ticketed for being illegally parked.  The earlier you can get on the trail the better, but you might get lucky.  The guidebooks talk about break-ins at Ke&#8217;e Beach and while we did not see this, Ha&#8217;ena has better visibility.</p>

<p>We filtered all our water.  The guidebooks warn about Leptospirosis and while I am not sure how prevalent this is better to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>There are a lot of long term campers there but there are also plenty of spots.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the hike was a lot of fun and I totally recommend it!</p>
