			Standing Up for Net Neutrality</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Currently there are many political issues that demand
attention however in my opinion there are none that would affect more
people than the possible destruction of net neutrality.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">Net neutrality</a> is simply the principle that all data on the internet
should be treated the same. It does not matter if you are visiting Fox
News or Mother Jones - the data and content from both of these
websites (as well as from every other website) should be treated as
equal and that data should be served equally by all Internet Service Providers. Losing net neutrality could
lead to an internet that favors
one of these two sites based on which site is willing to pay more. I
chose these sites because they are such polar opposites but at the same
time we live in a country that allows for such opposites to
have equal protection of freedom of speech. I may disagree with the content of a particular
website but
I do not think it should be served any differently than the website of a
site I do agree with. Destruction of net neutrality will lead to greater
influence wielded by larger corporations and could
stifle smaller websites and startups.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is still time to act. On July 12, various online
communities and users will come together to stand tall and sound the
alarm about the FCC&rsquo;s attack on net neutrality. Join us
<a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12">here</a>!</p>

			Pronto Post-mortem</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Pronto bike share ends this Friday March 31st and I will miss it for
sure. I <a href="http://zachstednick.name/blog/2016/02/09/thoughts-on-pronto/">wrote about why Pronto mattered to me</a> and I
even rode a Pronto bike in the 25
mile <a href="http://www.obliteride.org/">Obliteride</a> last year:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/IMG_2260.JPG"></p>

<p>In October 2015, there was a Pronto sponsored
<a href="https://www.prontocycleshare.com/datachallenge">contest</a> to visualize
bikeshare ride data. I created an
<a href="http://prontostories.com/">entry</a> which although did not win, was a
nice introduction for me to learn mapping with
<a href="d3js.org">D3</a>. As I was
checking out the Pronto site one last time today I noticed that they had
updated their publically available dataset to include 2016
ride data as well as the 2015 ride data.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/pronto_historical_ridership.png"></p>

<p>To me it seems that Pronto had a hard time expanding and encouraging
repeat riders. Unfortunately we do not have the membership data but if
we can assume that people who did not ride much in 2015 did not renew
their membership in 2016 then it looks pretty clear that Pronto was hurting
more than people thought. Also, it looked like they had good success in
2015 with getting people to buy day passes especially during peak tourist
season in the summer and were able to replicate that success in 2016. I
feel there is a need for a dedicated
bike share in Seattle however this iteration of bike share does not
appear to be the solution we need.</p>

<p>I went back to the Pronto site to fetch all my data because of an idea I
worked on then abandoned last summer. The idea was for a website that
was basically <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> for Pronto
whereby you compared your ride time data to everyone else&rsquo;s and mapped out how
fast you were compared to them. Pronto did not make it easy to download
all your trip data so I ended up having to write a webscraper to get out
my own data (Hint, hint Pronto 2.0!) which I put at this <a href="https://github.com/stedy/pronto-scraper">GitHub
repository</a>. I never was able
to get my project past the personal level and my ultimate goal was to
simply make a map of the route and add
in plots. Here is an example of all trips from Fairview Ave N &amp; Ward St
to Westlake Ave &amp; 6th Ave:</p>

<iframe src="http://zachstednick.com/strava_for_pronto_demo.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="height:700px; width:1260px;" scrolling="no"></iframe>


<p>I&rsquo;m sad that I can&rsquo;t work on this project anymore but maybe with Pronto
2.0 I will be able to revist this idea.</p>

			Have There Been More Upsets in the NCAA Tournament Recently?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have been following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament">NCAA Men&rsquo;s Basketball
Tournament</a>
for as long
as I can remember and with Selection Sunday coming up, I wondered if
there
have been more or less upsets in recent tournaments. To look at this
visually I used a hypothetical perfect bracket as a reference (i.e. #1
seed beats #16 seed, #2 seed beats #15 seed all the way to #1 seed beating a #2 seed). I
took the sum of all the winning seed numbers at each round in the
Regional Tournament and used that as the denominator
for comparison with the other Regional Tournaments for that particular
year.</p>

<p>I went back in time as far as I could but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NCAA_Division_I_Men's_Basketball_Tournament">2007
Tournament</a>
finally harmonized the names of the Regional tournaments with the names
East, West, South, and
Midwest which made for easier comparison across years.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/NCAA_by_region.png"></p>

<p>Clearly there have been quite a lot of upsets in the past ten years
especially within the Midwest Region.</p>

<p>I then went back and looked at all games back to 1985 when
the Tournament first expanded to 64 teams. For this I did not have all
the Regional Tournament information so I just looked at all the games
(except the Final Four).</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/NCAA_all_by_year.png"></p>

<p>The aggregate data is pretty volatile year over year as well with a low
in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NCAA_Division_I_Men's_Basketball_Tournament">2007</a>. If anything, this shows we should be in for another great year of NCAA tournament basketball complete with some (hopefully many) exciting upsets.</p>

			A Forgotten Cron Job Leads to Interesting Results</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On January 1, 2016 I set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> job to perform a daily count of the number of Twitter followers of the two main Gubernatorial candidates in Washington State: <a href="https://twitter.com/GovInslee">Jay Inslee</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BillBryantWA">Bill Bryant</a>. I was not attempting to predict the election or do anything with the data, I just wanted to count followers until Election Day 2016 and hopefully plot some interesting results. I checked on Election Day and the trend lines remained pretty much the same as they did at the start of the year so I abandonded my idea. Today I was cleaning out my crontab file and I found that the cron job was still running. I added a solid line for the 2016 Election Day and dashed line for the 2017 Presidential Inauguration.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/Inslee_vs_Bryant.png"></p>

<p>To me, the follower count data after the inauguration is the most interesting but it is just count data and I am not sure how much you can really read into it. If anything, forgetting the cron job was a pleasant surprise that reminded me of this guy who took a screenshot of the New York Times frontpage everyday for 5 years <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCKGOiauJCE">YouTube</a>.</p>

			First Book of the Year</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last year I started off the year by making Ashlee Vance&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/15743242/book/124695914">biography</a>
of Elon Musk the first book I read all year.
I wanted to start 2016 off better than 2015 and thought this book might
help my thinking. The story is on Musk is quite interesting if anything
to simply show how much he believes in himself even when the odds seem
stacked against him and the money in the bank grows lower. I tried to
use Musk&rsquo;s story to improve my own self-confidence and I felt like the most concrete way I
was able to do so was to reduce the amount I took on and instead focus
on doing a better job of what I had in front of me.</p>

<p>I will be repeating this little project in 2017 by starting the year off
by reading <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/8586497">Spread Spectrum:Hedy Lamarr and
the mobile phone</a> by Rob
Walters. I know very little about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum">spread spectrum
technology</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr">Hedy
Lamarr</a> had a very
interesting life and is greatly underappreciated in
modern society. Hopefully this book will prove to be as motivational
over the course of the year in a similar manner as Musk&rsquo;s biography was.</p>

			Election 2016</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It has now been a month since the 2016 US Presidential election and I am
still stunned by the outcome but am ready to move on.</p>

<p>The major issues I focused on while voting at the Presidential level
were a better climate policy
and more equal treatment for minorities and other marginalized
populations. When I stop and think about why these were the major issues
for me, I realize that I am pretty fortunate. I have a great job,
generally feel safe, and am optimistic overall about the future and the
economy.</p>

<p>The biggest realization for me was that although I care deeply about
these issues on a national level, I need to be more involved at the
community level.</p>

<p>After thinking about it, there are three ways I want to get more
politically involved:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Increase the amount of money I donate to specific organizations on a
recurring basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Get more involved with organizations that focus on climate advocacy
and immigrant populations. I did do some volunteer work with
<a href="https://carbonwa.org">CarbonWA</a> and I want to get more involved with
them as well as with an organization that focuses on immigrants such as
<a href="http://www.rewa.org/">ReWA</a></p></li>
<li><p>Write more letters to elected officials about the issues I am most
passionate about. I have helped make a github
<a href="https://github.com/openseattle/seattle-boundaries">repo</a> of all the
boundaries of my hometown and I have never used this for any reason
other than looking up addresses. At least I know where to look to figure
out the various districts I live in.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Will these actions by me make a difference on the national level? Not
likely but hard to say. What they will do for sure is to make an impact
at the local level and will help me to improve the community around me.
If these issues are important
enough for me to write this post about, then it goes to show that they
are important enough for me to get more involved with.</p>

			Has the Pac-12 Network Decreased UW Home Football Game Attendance?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The University of Washington Husky football team is taking on Rutgers
this Saturday with kickoff at 11 AM PST. This is awfully early to start a game, especially a game that occurs during Labor Day weekend. The game is being aired on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Network">Pac-12 Network</a> which is about to enter its fifth year of operation. This made me wonder, with the presence of the Pac-12 Network, has attendance decreased at home UW football games?</p>

<p>Fortunately, Wikipedia lists game attendance which allows for a quick
overview of UW home games stratified by network:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/UW_football_attendance_by_TV.png"></p>

<p>The purple dots are UW home games shown on the Pac-12 network, not
entirely convincing but at first glance they don&rsquo;t look too great for
the network. I then looked at only home Pac-10/Pac-12 games and looked at attendance
by season:</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/UW_football_total_attendance.png"></p>

<p>That high point in this figure is UW versus Oregon in 2013 while that particularly low point in 2015 was versus Arizona on Halloween
which happened to fall on a Thursday in 2015. Why some executive at FS1 thought it would be a good idea to schedule a game then is beyond me.</p>

<p>In 2012, UW played its home games at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CenturyLink_Field">CenturyLink
Field</a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husky_Stadium">Husky
Stadium</a> was renovated. For the 2013 season the UW football team returned to play at a smaller Husky
Stadium, did either of these factors impact attendance?</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/UW_football_percentage_capacity.png"></p>

<p>Not really, there is a minimal difference in stadium size which is
reflected in this identical-looking figure.</p>

<p>What Pac-12 opponents were the biggest draws on average?</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Opponent </th>
<th style="text-align:right;"> Average Attendance </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>          Oregon </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 69584</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Washington State </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 68862</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>        Colorado </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 64373</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>             USC </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 64046</td>

<tr>
<td>    Oregon State </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 63777</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>        Stanford </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 63360</td>

<tr>
<td>            UCLA </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 62544</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>         Arizona </td>
<td style="text-align:right;"> 60756</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Obviously there are a lot of factors that can&rsquo;t be captured by game
attendance alone but with a significant budget deficit largely blamed on
<a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-huskies/uw-athletic-department-projects-budget-deficit-of-14-million-for-2016-fiscal-year/">reduced
attendance</a>, it seems like it might be time for the UW to analyze if the Pac-12 Network has really been worth the investments to date.</p>

			This American Life Stats</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Lately I have been listening to episodes of <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American
Life</a> faster than they are making them
which means I have been going back to the archive for past unheard shows. Their website has a nice <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/user/login">user section</a> where you can log in and mark episodes you have heard and your favorites. The archives are arranged by year which naturally got me thinking about the number episodes I have listened to by year. A search of GitHub revealed many libraries for downloading episodes of the podcast but none that were interested in user statistics so I decided to write my own library. I am still very much beginner level with technologies such as passing cookies and CSRF requests which is why I ultimately ended up using <a href="https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Splinter</a> which just lets you automate browser actions. I used that to login and navigate the TAL archives by year. I then used <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> to parse the HTML. Finally, I just wanted to visualize the results so I used Mike Bostock&rsquo;s <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304">D3 Bar Chart example</a>.</p>

			Slopeplots of African GDP With Ggplot2</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I finally got around to reading <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/13493349">Poor
Numbers</a> by <a href="http://mortenjerven.com/">Morton
Jerven</a> and found it really interesting. Basically Jerven argues that
academic literature has either &ldquo;neglected the issue of data quality and
therefore accepted the data at face value or dismissed the data as
unreliable and therefore irrelevant&rdquo; and this causes many issues with
the more data-driven approach to international aid in recent years.</p>

<p>The key table in this book was (in my opinion) a largely inscrutable table that showed
African economies ranked by per capita GDP with data from three
different sources of national income data: the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development
Indicators</a>,
<a href="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm">Angus
Maddison</a>, and
<a href="http://www.rug.nl/research/ggdc/data/pwt/">Penn World Tables</a>. The
differences in the rankings is hard to parse in a table but  would
theoretically lend
themselves well to a slopegraph originally proposed by Edward Tufte in
<a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/7983">The Visual Display of Quantitative
Information</a></p>

<p><img src="http://charliepark.org/images/slopegraphs/slopegraph.gif"></p>

<p>Although not a true slopeplot, I was able to use a combination of
<code>geom_line</code> from ggplot2 and the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/directlabels/">directlabels
package</a> to
generate the following plot (which I will admit is a bit of a hack):</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/AfricanEconomiesbyGDP.png"></p>

<p>I was mainly interested in observing the variation in the top ten or so
countries which this plot handles well. The remaining 35 or so countries
are difficult to tell apart mostly due to very large differences in GDP.
A log transformed plot shows that
there is generally more consistency within the different rating agencies
but some variation between them.</p>

<p><img src="http://zachstednick.com/AfricanEconomiesbyGDP_logscaled.png"></p>

<p>Slopegraphs are an effective and efficient way to visualize this type of data which
is odd because I feel like they are rarely used and only barely
mentioned in Tufte&rsquo;s works. Hopefully more people being exposed to them
will result in further usage.</p>

			Changes in NPS Visits Over Time With D3</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This year is the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service and I
was curious about how park attendance had changed recently. Andrew
Flowers of FiveThirtyEight had a nice
<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-national-parks-have-never-been-more-popular/">overview</a>
using official <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/National">NPS data</a>.
The article was interesting but contrary to most of FiveThirtyEight&rsquo;s
pieces there was a stunning lack of interactivity in what I felt was the
main figure of the piece</p>

<p>I remade the figure using that same data but just focusong on 2006 until
2015 and basically the popular parks stay popular and vice versa:</p>

<p>Basically, Great Smoky Mountains NP has dominated attendance since its
creation but what other parks have recently become popular? I used
<a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> to make a simple line plot that allowed for
interactively exploring park attendance based on year over year change
from the mean attendance over the last ten years:</p>

<p>Clearly a spike in recent years - maybe due to lower gas prices or
increased popularity of social media?</p>

<p>Also, I was curious about what the trend looked like for the National
Monuments.</p>

<p>The most immediate trend that jumps out is the effect of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty#Closures_and_reopening_.282001.E2.80.93present.29">closing</a> of the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm">Statue of Liberty</a> in 2011 which indirectly caused a slowdown in visits to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/cacl/index.htm">Castle Clinton</a>.</p>

<p>I aim to visit some new parks and monuments this summer and hopefully
looking at the data like this will help me avoid the crowds.</p>
